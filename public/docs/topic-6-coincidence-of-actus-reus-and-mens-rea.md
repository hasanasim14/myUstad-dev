## Mini lecture 1 - How case law develops

The first lecture in the series deals with the important case, Miller. Miller tells us a great deal about the criminal law. It illustrates the core principle in criminal law, namely the core requirement that the prosecution prove an actus reus and mens rea which correspond with each other and coincide in point of time. It also tells us something important about how the criminal law works.

The criminal law is not a static system of rules to be applied unthinkingly to a fact situation. Rather it is a resource by which counsel for the defense and prosecution can argue their ways through to a conclusion. In this case, a homeless man entered unoccupied house and after a short time went into a bedroom and lay down on the bed. He lit a cigarette and began to smoke but within a short while, he had fallen asleep having omitted to extinguish the cigarette.

Let's put these facts in the defendant's own words. "Last night I went out for a few drinks and at closing time I went back to the house where I've been keeping for a couple of weeks. I went upstairs into the back bedroom where I've been sleeping. I lay on my mattress and lit a cigarette. I must have fell to asleep because I woke up to find the mattress on fire. I just got up and went into the next room and went back to sleep. Then the next thing I remember was the police and fire people arriving. I hadn't got anything to put the fire out with so I just left it."

The charge put against Miller was as follows, arson counter intersection 1, 1 and 3 of the Criminal Damage Act 1971. The particulars of the offense are as follows. That on a date unknown between August the 13th and 16th, 1980 without lawful excuse, the defendant damaged by fire a house known as No 9, Grantham Road, Sparkbrook, intending to do damage to such property or recklessly as to whether such property would be damaged.

The case was heard by a jury at Leicester Crown Court, he was convicted. He then appealed. The appeal was that the undisputed facts does not disclose any offense under section 1 of the Criminal Damage Act 1971.

This appeal was dismissed but leave to appeal to the House of Lords was granted on the ground that an important question of law was involved, namely whether the actus reus of the offensive arson is present when a defendant accidentally starts a fire thereafter intending to destroy or damage property belonging to another or being reckless as to whether any such property would be destroyed or damaged fails to take any steps to extinguish the fire or prevent damage to such property by that fire.

This was the defense case, "I did not intentionally or recklessly damage the property. Although I did damage the property, I did so while I was asleep and so I did not damage it with the mens rea required by section 1 subsection 1 of the Criminal Damage Act 1971."

This was the prosecution case, "You did damage the property intentionally or recklessly for two alternative reasons. First, arson is the result crime. The actus reus lasts right until the fire is extinguished. In other words, arson involves an act which continues until the fire is out. You woke up before the fire was out and as soon as you'd realised what had happened you became reckless as to the further damage which will be caused if you did nothing about it. Alternatively, the actus reus of criminal damage includes an omission in breach of duty, and a duty existed here to remedy the dangerous situation which you had caused. Your omission to put the fire out was accompanied by knowledge that this would cause further damage. In other words, you were reckless."

Why is Miller so important? First, it illustrates the principle actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea by challenging its meaning. It tells us something new about an actus reus. An actus reus is not simply a bodily movement which finishes when the body stops moving, it is a dynamic which in result crimes lasts until the result is complete.

This is how Lord Diplock explains his idea, "I cannot see any good reason why, so far as liability under criminal law is concerned, it should matter at what point of time before the resultant damage is complete a person becomes aware that he has done a physical act which, whether or not he appreciated that it would at the time when he did it, does in fact create a risk that property of another will be damaged, so far as, at the moment of awareness, it lies within his power to take steps, either himself or by calling for the assistance of the fire brigade if this be necessary, to prevent or minimise the damage to the property at risk."

The second reason why Miller is so important is that it extends the previous range of duty situations which were limited to statutory duties and duties arising out of special relationships and from the voluntary assumptions of responsibility. A duty of intervention also now exists to remedy any dangerous situation which a person is responsible for creating.

The third reason why Miller is so important is that it is a crucial reminder to you the student that criminal law is not a set of static rules but a fluctuating body of principles tempered in the fire of legal argument in court.

What happened in this case, is that barristers in court used skilled reasoning to convince the judge that the demands of morality were consistent with the underlying principles of English law. These underlying principles or criminal liability requires blameworthy conduct. Not a blameworthy act specifically, actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea. The demands of morality are, those who are responsible for the creation of a dangerous situation must put it right because it is their doing.

This is how changes to the criminal law occur. The new compulsory question is designed to encourage you to practice this kind of reasoning and argument. Fourth, Miller qualifies the principle that actus reus and mens rea coincide in point of time. The defendant's case was that he admitted the act setting light to the bed. He admitted that he realized upon waking up that the fire could spread, mens rea. His argument was that actus reus and mens rea did not coincide in point of time.

When the act was done he was asleep and so he had no mens rea. When he awoke and the mens rea was formed, the act was over and so there was no accompanying actus reus. Miller tells us that this reasoning was false. The actus reus and mens rea did coincide. First, the actus reus, arson, lasted until the fire was out by which time mens rea had been formed. Alternatively, the actus reus was the omission in breach of duty to put the fire out which was accompanied by a reckless state of mind.

Finally, Miller has the potential to create a completely new approach to understanding when a duty of intervention arises in cases of omission. It tells us that a duty arises whenever a person is responsible for the creation of a dangerous situation to remedy that situation. This is only a step or two behind saying that a duty arises whenever a person is a factual cause of a dangerous situation.

To understand this point, let's change the facts of Miller very slightly. Assume the fire had been started by Miller's bedmate and he awoke to find bedmate gone and the bed smoldering. Would he be still guilty of arson if he did not put the fire out or call the fire brigade? On the face of it, he would not be. First, the fire was not caused by his act and so there was no continuing act.

Second, the case tells us that the duty arises because Miller was responsible for creating the dangerous situation. Whereas here, it was the bedmate, whose responsibility this was. However, if this case came to court, you can be sure that there would be a very strong argument put by prosecuting counsel that the principle in Miller should be extended to include all people who are part of the causal chain, which led to the dangerous situation. This would include Mr. Miller, as they had entered the house together and gone to bed together. The fire is not his doing but it would not have happened without him.

In other words, here's a factual cause. The courts are halfway to accepting this radical change in how we view the principles underlying the creation of new duty situations. In Athens, the supplier of drugs to the deceased, who took them voluntarily was held to be under a duty to provide help when the deceased went into a coma. She had not created the dangerous situation, the deceased had but she contributed to it and this was enough.

If the Miller bedmate case came up in an examination, this is the kind of reasoning which you should adopt, do not simply apply the existing law. Make use of it by arguing for a principled development of the law, based upon what you think Miller should have done and why. If it helps, I think that Miller should have intervened in the bedmate variation, even though he didn't create or contribute to it, because of his causal involvement. I would hope such an argument would succeed.

## Introduction

So far, we have learned that criminal liability requires actus reus (wrongdoing) and mens rea (criminal fault/guilty mind). Actus reus is the external element in the crime package; mens rea is the internal element – that which the prosecution has to show was going on in the defendant's mind. We need to understand something further about these elements, namely that in relation to any given crime, actus reus and mens rea should, in principle, coincide and correspond.

There are two facets to this premise. The first is that actus reus and mens rea should coincide in point of time; that is, liability should depend upon proof that the defendant had the relevant mental attitude at the moment of doing the acts which form the *actus reus* of a criminal offence. This is known as **temporal coincidence**. The second facet is that offence definitions should match any relevant conduct, consequence or circumstance with an exactly matching mental state on the part of the defendant. This is known as the correspondence principle. Without such correspondence, it is thought, the defendant will be punished for the wrong harm.

## 6.1 Temporal coincidence

Temporal coincidence is an easy concept to grasp, a less easy concept to apply. Here are some examples falling on either side of the liability fence.

### **Illustration 1**
D takes V's wallet, intending to steal from it. A few seconds later he changes his mind and puts the wallet back. Is he guilty of theft?

The common-sense answer is no. D momentarily had the mens rea for theft but since he decided to put the wallet back there was no *actus reus*. This is not the legal answer. To discover this we need to apply the lawyer's method. This requires us to consider the definition of theft. Here is a simplified version:

• a person is guilty of theft if they take property belonging to another intending not to return it.

This definition tells us that the offence is made out, since, at the time D took the property, it was his intention not to return it. Actus reus and mens rea, thus, coincided in point of time.

An example of a case where this principle was at issue is Ahmad (1986) Crim LR 739. A landlord was charged with harassing his tenant with intent to make him give up occupation. The landlord was not guilty of this crime because he had formed the intention only after he had committed the acts (removing windows) relied upon as acts of harassment. See Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 4.5.D.2 'Omissions: the common law approach'.

### **Study task 1**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 8.1 'Introduction' and answer the following question.

D is a contract killer, with a contract to kill V. He drives to V's house with his gun. On the way there D is involved in an accident, when a pedestrian unexpectedly runs out in front of his car. The pedestrian is killed. D gets out of his car to discover the victim is V. D rubs his hands, pleased that he has been saved some effort.

Consider the reasons as to whether or not D is guilty of murder?

Show feedback

No. Murder requires actus reus and mens rea to coincide in point of time. In other words, the act which kills has to be performed in furtherance of an intention to kill (or cause serious injury).

### 6.1.1 Avoiding the coincidence requirement

If act and mind do not coincide in time, this is not always fatal to a successful prosecution. This is because it may be possible to ignore the initial act and graft liability on to a subsequent omission. This is what happened in Miller (1983) (see Topic 3 - Learning activity 3). The act which caused the fire in this case was unaccompanied by mens rea, since D was asleep at the time. Mens rea was formed only after the act was complete, when D woke up and realised his bed was on fire. This will normally mean that D would escape liability for criminal damage. The House of Lords ruled, however, that the actus reus could be based upon D's omission to put out the fire, which omission was accompanied by mens rea (recklessness). Actus reus and mens rea coincided, therefore, at the moment of D's deciding not to put the fire out because here the actus reus was D's omission. The crime was constituted by his reckless (mens rea) omission in breach of duty (actus reus).

Another way in which the coincidence requirement has been avoided is by reference to the continuing act doctrine. In Fagan v MPC [1969] 1 QB 439, there appeared to be a classic example of a case where the mens rea and actus reus did not coincide, since mens rea was formed only after the harm-causing act had been performed. D had innocently parked his car on a police officer's foot, which he realised only after he had turned the engine off. At that moment, he decided not to remove the car. D was convicted at first instance of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty. He argued that there had been no assault, since the **act** of assault took place without mens rea, and when he later formed the mens rea there was no accompanying act. It was central to his argument that assault required an act and could not be committed by omission. The Queen's Bench Division agreed that assault required an act and could not be committed by omission. Nevertheless, it affirmed the conviction.

#### **Study task 2**

- a. Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 8.1.A.1 'Qualifications to the requirement of temporal coincidence', Section (b) 'Continuing acts'. How did the court justify affirming the conviction when it agreed that assault could not be committed by omission?
- b. Read the case of Director of Public Prosecutions v Santana-Bermudez [2003] EWHC 2908 (Admin) and consider what the act was which constituted the assault in this case.

Show feedback

- a. Because the act (parking the car) was still being performed when the mens rea was formed. It did not come to an end on switching off the engine. Compare treading on someone's foot which lasts as long as the pressure lasts.
- b. The act was inducing the officer to conduct the search. The Miller principle does not apply as assault cannot be committed by omission.

### 6.1.2 The supposed corpse cases

The principles in Miller and Fagan constitute two qualifications to the rule that actus reus and mens rea should coincide in point of time. But they are not exceptions: they are ways of avoiding its application. The supposed corpse cases, however, are an exception to the rule. These are cases where the defendant has attacked the victim and, wrongly concluding the victim to be dead, disposed of the body, with the disposal being the actual cause of death.

The first case in which this complex scenario surfaced, Meli v The Queen [1954] 1 WLR 228, was a case involving a preconceived plan to kill the victim. The plan was to lure V to a hut in a deserted spot, beat him to death and then roll him over a cliff to fake an accident. The plan nearly worked perfectly. The defendants lured V successfully to the spot, beat him up, and then, having concluded that V was dead, rolled him over the cliff. Actually, V was not dead at the time. He died as a result of exposure from being left at the foot of the cliff. The defendants were charged with murder. They argued that the act which caused death (the disposal of the supposed corpse) was unaccompanied by mens rea, since, at that time, they thought death had already occurred, and so actus reus and mens rea did not coincide. Not surprisingly, the Privy Council rejected this argument.

It appears to their Lordships impossible to divide up what was really one transaction in this way. There is no doubt that the accused set out to do all these acts in order to achieve their plan and as parts of their plan; and it is much too refined a ground of judgement to say that, because they were under a misapprehension at one stage and thought that their guilty purpose had been achieved before in fact it was achieved, therefore they are to escape the penalties of the law. (Lord Reid)

In Church [1966] 1 QB 59, where there was no preconceived plan, a different explanation was given, which centred on the chain of causation. D panicked when, having struck V, she fell down, apparently dead. D threw the supposed corpse in the river, and V died of drowning. D was charged and convicted of manslaughter but argued that actus reus and mens rea did not coincide. The Queen's Bench Division disagreed, stating that homicide is the appropriate verdict if the appellant's 'behaviour from the moment he first struck her to the moment when he threw her into the river' could be regarded 'as a series of acts designed to cause death or grievous bodily harm'. If that was how the jury 'regarded the accused's behaviour, it mattered not whether he believed her to be alive or dead when he threw her in the river' (Edmund-Davies J).

Put simply, D had the mens rea for manslaughter when he first struck V. V died following a series of further acts on D's part, none of which broke the chain of causation.

This causation account was elaborated upon in Le Brun [1992] QB 61. The defendant struck his wife in the course of an argument outside their front door. She fell down, struck her head and lapsed into unconsciousness. She died as a result of injuries sustained when D dragged her from the road into the house to avoid detection. In response to the argument that mens rea and actus reus did not coincide, Lord Lane CJ for the Court of Appeal said:

It would be possible to express the problem as one of causation. The original unlawful blow to the chin was a causa sine qua non (but for cause) of the later actus reus. It was the opening event in a series which was to culminate in death: the first link in the chain of causation, to use another metaphor. It cannot be said that the actions of the appellant in dragging the victim away with the intention of evading liability broke the chain which linked the initial blow with the death. In short, in circumstances such as the present, which is the only concern of this court, the act which causes death, and the necessary mental state to constitute manslaughter, need not coincide in point of time.

## Discussion activity 1

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Sections 8.1.A 'Temporal coincidence' and 5.5.B.1 'The general framework for imputing cause'

Lord Lane CJ says in Le Brun 'It cannot be said that the actions of the appellant in dragging the victim away with the intention of evading liability broke the chain which linked the initial blow with the death'.

If, as he also states, the 'problem is (only) one of causation'

- a. why should it matter what the appellant's intentions were in dragging the victim away?
- b. What intentions would break the chain of causation and why?

## 6.2 Correspondence principle

Simply put, the correspondence principle requires a corresponding mental element for each aspect of the *actus* reus: i.e. conduct, circumstance and consequence. The principle derives from the broader ethical principle that conviction and punishment be deserved. If a person can be punished for doing X without a mental element corresponding to X, then the punishment is undeserved and unfair.

### **Illustration 2**

A person is quilty of theft if they dishonestly appropriate property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. The *actus reus* of theft is appropriating property belonging to another. The correspondence principle, as a minimum, requires that:

- a. A intends to appropriate the property. So, if the property is secreted in her bag without her knowing, the correspondence principle requires an acquittal.
- b. A intends to appropriate property belonging to another. This requires her to know or believe that the property she is appropriating belongs to someone else. So, if A takes an umbrella from a stand believing it is her own or has been abandoned, the correspondence principle demands an acquittal.

The correspondence principle is an ethical or normative principle rather than a descriptive principle. In other words, it states what 'ought' to be the legal position rather than what 'is' the legal position. In times past, the correspondence principle was rarely acknowledged and seldom adhered to. For example, a person who completely accidentally killed someone in the course of burgling their house was not only guilty of burglary but also of murder, even though they only had mens rea for the burglary. The mens rea for burglary (entering premises with intent to steal) was permitted to substitute for the mens rea for murder (intending to kill or cause serious injury). The idea was that those who do bad things should pay for the consequences, however far reaching and unexpected they may be.

### **Study task 3**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 8.1.A.1 'Qualifications to the requirement of definitional concurrence' and Section 8.1.B.1 'Definitional non-correspondence', and answer the following questions.

Adam, intending to teach Eve a lesson, breaks Eve's legs with a baseball bat. Eve attempting to get up, falls over and hits her head on the pavement, which kills her.

1. Does the correspondence principle permit Adam's liability for murder?

2. Is he in fact guilty of murder? Explain your reasoning.

This unjust rule, known as constructive fault) was abolished by the Homicide Act 1957 for murder, but remains applicable for a good many crimes, including manslaughter. Many commentators deplore this, demanding that the correspondence principle be respected for all core crimes.

In practice, a good many crimes can be committed without a perfect match between actus reus and mens rea. Indeed, the majority of crimes of violence bear an actus reus without a corresponding mental attitude. Murder is a prime example.

### Mini lecture 2 - COINCIDENCE OF ACTUS REUS AND MENS REA

In this mini-lecture, we explore the principle that the actus reus and the mens rea should coincide. A criminal liability usually requires the prosecution to establish, first, that A did something which the law prohibits, and second, was at fault in doing something which the law prohibits. What has not yet been discussed is the principle implicit in these two building blocks of criminal liability. Namely, that they must correspond with each other. In other words, actus reus and mens rea should coincide.

The correspondence principle. The correspondence principle requires the actus reus to correspond with the mens rea for the crime charged. They must, in other words, match. In *Pembliton*, D, intending to strike V, threw a brick at him. The brick missed and broke a window. D was charged with criminal damage. He was found not guilty. To gain a conviction for criminal damage, the prosecution must prove that D had the fault element for criminal damage. This had not been established. He had the fault element for assault, but this was not enough.

On the following two slides, I give you illustrations of the correspondence principle in operation. Now, turn the recording off and take a minute to look at the scenario on the slide.

W's act of poisoning the dog food results in H's death. Is W guilty of murder? The answer is no. Here, mens rea and actus reus do not correspond. W has committed the actus reus of murder, but it's only the mens rea for criminal damage. The two do not correspond. They don't match.

Here is another illustration. Again, turn the recording off and take a minute to look at the scenario.

This time Rover is killed by poisoned food meant for H. Is W guilty of criminal damage, that is to the dog? The answer is no. W has committed the actus reus of criminal damage, but her mens rea is not for criminal damage, but for murder. The two do not match.

In *Pembliton*, we have seen that if the prosecution can prove that D had the mens rea for crime Y, but cannot prove that D had the mens rea for the crime actually charged, which was crime X, they will fail. However, the prosecution made a bad mistake in *Pembliton*. What it should have done was to establish that D had the mens rea of criminal damage in addition to the mens rea of assault. This would have been easy. The victim was standing in front of the window, which was broken by the brick. This means that D almost certainly had the mens rea (that is recklessness), of criminal damage, as well as the mens rea for assault. A simple error of procedure meant that they did not get their conviction.

A second qualification to the correspondence principle is the doctrine of transferred malice. It applies when A commits the crime charged, but the victim of the crime was someone other than who A intended or foresaw. The rule is that if, with the fault element for harming Mr. X, A mistakenly harms Mrs. Y, this fault element with regard to Mr. X transfers over to the actus reus committed against Mrs. Y.

In *Latimer*, L aimed a blow with a belt at Mr. X. It missed Mr. X and hit Mr. Y, who, unknown to him, was standing behind him. L was found properly guilty of assault on Mr. Y.

Here is an illustration of the transferred malice principle in operation. Stop the recording and take a minute to look at it. Then return to the recording.

Is W guilty of murdering her daughter when she intended only to kill her husband? The answer is yes. The transferred malice principle applies. W intended to kill. She did kill. The intention she had towards H transfers to the actus reus committed against V so she can be convicted of murder.

The first eight slides concerned the requirement that actus reus and mens rea must match.

We turn now to the related topic of temporal coincidence. This principle holds that D can only be liable for committing crime X. If, at the very moment of committing the actus reus of crime X, he had the mens rea for crime X. Actus reus and mens rea must coincide in point in time, in addition to matching each other.

On this slide, we have a simple illustration of the requirement of temporal coincidence. Again, turn off the recording and take a look at the scenario. When you've done so, return to the recording.

The question is, is P guilty of murder? The simple answer is no. Actus reus and mens rea must coincide in point of time. That means, in order to be guilty of murder, the act which causes death must be accompanied by the fault element for murder, that is, an intention to kill. In short, to be guilty of murder in this case, P must have crashed his car in order to kill V. He didn't. This killing is a pure coincidence.

If act and mind do not coincide in time, this is not always fatal. We've dealt with points one and two in the first mini lecture.

Let's move on to the third qualification, to this principle that act and mind must coincide in point of time, the supposed corpse cases. In each of the above cases, D, thinking wrongly that he had already killed the victim by an act of violence, disposed of the victim's body. The victim then died as a result of the disposal. In *Thabo Meli*, D threw the supposed corpse off a cliff.

In *Church*, he threw the supposed corpse into a river. In *LeBrun*, he dropped the supposed corpse while trying to drag it into his house. In each case, the defense claimed that D was not guilty of homicide because the act which actually killed V was not accompanied by an intention to kill V, as D was of the opinion that V was already dead and so couldn't be killed. This argument was rejected in each case.

In *LeBrun*, Lord Lane explained this as a simple matter of causation. If A punches V and V dies, A is guilty of V's homicide, unless the chain of causation between the punch and the death is broken by something abnormal. None of the events in these three cases were abnormal. For example, throwing someone in a river after you've delivered what you thought was a fatal blow is just what we might expect. It's in no way abnormal.

Here is a problem. See if you can answer it. Again, turn off the recording and look at the scenario carefully. When you've done so, return to the recording.

Is Juliet guilty of criminal homicide? She will doubtless say no. After all, she dropped him while trying to take him to hospital. However, applying *LeBrun*, Juliet has no answer to a charge of criminal homicide. The chain of causation leading to the death began with the act involving the paperweight, and nothing which happened subsequently broke the chain of causation, so, actus reus and mens rea coincide.

## 6.3 Transferred malice: a qualification to the correspondence principle

No breach of the correspondence principle occurs if the defendant commits the formal *actus reus* of an offence with the relevant mens rea for that offence, but the subject matter of that actus reus was other than that intended or foreseen by the defendant.

### **Illustration 3**

D, intending to shoot B dead, misses B and kills C, an innocent bystander.

D is still guilty of murder. He has the mens rea for murder and he has committed the actus reus of murder. He has also committed the offence of attempted murder in relation to B (R v Gnango [2011] UKSC 59). The criminal law permits the mens rea in relation to B to be joined to the actus reus committed against C. This qualification is known as the doctrine of transferred malice.

The effect of transferred malice ... is that the intended victim and the actual victim are treated as if they were one, so that what was intended to happen to the first person (but did not happen) is added to what actually did happen to the second person (but was not intended to happen), with the result that what was intended and what happened are married to make a notionally intended and actually consummated crime. The cases are treated as if the actual victim had been the intended victim from the start.

(Lord Mustill in A-G's Reference (No 3 of 1994) [1998] AC 245 at 262.)

The principle applies to all crimes of violence, not merely murder. So, in Latimer (1886) 17 QBD 359, D swung a belt at X in a pub, which missed X and hit V, standing behind him. D was found guilty of assault against V although he neither intended to hit V nor even knew V was there. In each case, the malice/intention D entertained with respect to the intended victim transfers to the actus reus of the crime committed against the real victim.

It applies even where the harm suffered by the unintended victim differs from that which the attacker intended his victim to suffer. This was made clear in R v Grant [2014] EWCA Crim 143. D fired shots into a shop intending to kill X. The shots missed and hit V1 and V2, who were bystanders. D was charged with attempted murder (in regard to X) and causing grievous bodily harm with intent, contrary to s.18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, in relation to V1 and V2. D argued that the transferred malice principle only applied where the crime committed against the unintended victim was identical to that intended against the intended victim. That was not the case here. He argued that the fact he intended to kill X meant that he did not have the intention to cause X GBH. As a result, there was no 'malice' to transfer. The court rejected this argument. If D had the intention to kill X he must also have had the intention to do him serious injury by definition.

One qualification is in order. The principle applies only with respect to crimes of the same family. In Pembliton (1874), D threw a stone at X in the course of a fight with X and Y. It missed X and broke a window. D was indicted for criminal damage. The Court for Crown Cases Reserved said that the intention to harm X (a crime against the person) was not sufficient to support a conviction for causing criminal damage to V's property (a crime against property). Lord Blackburn said that D could be guilty of criminal damage only if he intended or foresaw damage to the window. Since that had not been argued by the prosecution, the conviction was quashed.
