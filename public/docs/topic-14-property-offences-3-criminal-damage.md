## Mini lecture 1 -  CRIMINAL DAMAGE: THE CONDUCT ELEMENT

Prof William Wilson


This mini-lecture addresses the conduct element in criminal damage. The Criminal Damage Act of 1971 was designed to simplify the law and to ensure consistency with other property offenses, particularly theft.

Section 1, subsection 1 of the 1971 Act defines the simple form of criminal damage as follows. A person who without lawful excuse destroys or damages property belonging to another intending to destroy or damage any such property or being reckless, whether any such property would be destroyed or damaged, shall be guilty of an offense.

The conduct elements of criminal damage are that the defendant must destroy or damage property, that property must belong to another person, and there must be no lawful excuse. We should be concentrating on the first two of these conduct elements.

What counts as criminal damage? Is this painting by Banksy criminal damage? Is what the officer is doing to the wall criminal damage?

Let's look at this question in greater detail. The *actus reus* refers to destroying or damaging property belonging to another. What does "destroys or damage" mean? In *Roe v Kingerlee*, it was said that any alteration to the physical nature of property may amount to damage depending on the circumstances. The court said that what constitutes criminal damage is a matter of fact and degree, and it is for the magistrates applying their common sense to decide whether what occurred was damaged or not.

The facts of the case were straightforward. D smeared mud graffiti on the wall of a prison cell. The divisional court held that this was criminal damage, although removal required only the application of water. It was a question of fact and degree, applying common sense.

Whether something has been damaged is not a question of law, it's a question of fact and degree. The nature of the property must be taken into consideration.

Now, let's compare *Roe v Kingerlee* with A, *a juvenile v R*. In this latter case it was held, unlike in *Roe v Kingerlee*, that spitting on a policeman's uniform was not criminal damage.

Does one damage property by rendering a whole machine inoperable? This was a question to be decided in *Fisher*. In this case, D blocked up a part of a steam engine rendering it inoperable. It took two hours but no parts to repair. It was held that this was damage of the machine as a whole because it was rendered useless. Temporary impairment is also sufficient. In *Lloyd*, it was held that placing a wheel clamp on a parked vehicle was criminal damage.

We turn now to property. Section 10 of the act defines property. Stop the recording and have a look at this section. When you've done so, return to the recording.

The definition of property, as you will appreciate, is the same as for theft with two qualifications. First, only tangible property that is personal and real property is covered. Second, property includes land and things on land, so breaking a window is criminal damage. Setting fire to a house is criminal damage. When property is damaged by fire, it is termed arson.

Property includes food and drink. In *Roper v Knott*, it was held that adulterating milk with water was criminal damage. It includes also animals and pets. Killing or harming a dog, cow, or sheep is criminal damage, if the dog, cow, or sheep has an owner.

We look now at the next element in the *actus reus*, namely belonging to another. Stop the recording and read Section 10 and its interpretation of property. When you've done so, return to the slide.

Belonging to another then means much as it does with theft. It is not criminal damage to damage property which has no owner, such as wild animals. If it has an owner, or someone is in possessional control of it, it may be the subject of a charge of criminal damage.

We've discovered that criminal damage is committed where the defendant damages property belonging to another person. It follows that a person cannot be liable for simple criminal damage for damaging his own property.

In *Denton*, it was ruled that this includes cases where the property is damaged by a third party with the owner's consent. In this case, D and T, wishing to perpetrate an insurance fraud on T's insurance company, agreed that D would set fire to T's factory. D did so and was caught by the police. He was charged and convicted of criminal damage. His conviction was quashed. Simple damage cannot be committed where the defendant damages his own property, and it is not committed where a third party damages property at the owner's request.

## Introduction

The Criminal Damage Act 1971 was designed to simplify the law and to ensure consistency with other property offences (principally theft). It contains a basic, or simple, offence of damaging property and an aggravated offence where the damage to property is foreseen or intended to endanger life. Arson (damaging property by fire) is a form of criminal damage. As it is a serious form, it is generally charged as arson.

## Mini lecture 2 - The fault element in criminal damage

Prof William Wilson, Criminal law

This is a lecture on the fault element in criminal damage. We have dealt already with some general aspects of mens rea. Here, we're going to concentrate on one key feature, namely recklessness. When does a person damage property recklessly?

The general law relating to criminal damage appears in the criminal damage act 1971, section one, subsection one, take a look for a moment.

The fault element here is intention or recklessness. Both carry their general meaning. A person can, therefore, commit criminal damage intentionally or recklessly. Intention carries the same meaning as elsewhere in the criminal law. A defendant intends criminal damage when it is the purpose behind their act. A jury may also find the defendant to intend to criminal damage when, although it is not their purpose, they know it is a virtually certain side effect of what they do intend. So, if D posts a letter bomb to his employer's premises for the purpose of killing a fellow employee, he commits not only murder of the employee, but also criminal damage to the employer's premises, because D knows this is a virtually certain consequence of his action, although it is not his objective.

Recklessness is defined by the draft criminal code. This definition has been adopted by the courts. Take a look at this definition. In short, a person acts recklessly when they knowingly take an unreasonable risk. Until the House of Lords decision in G, in 2004, the earlier case of Caldwell was authority for the proposition that recklessness did not require proof, that the risk of causing damage was actually foreseen by the defendant, so long as it was foreseeable to the normal person. This was, of course, harsh on the young and those with learning difficulties.

In G itself, the defendants were 11 and 12, respectively. They had lit a fire with paper in a car park, where they'd set up camp. The fire spread to a neighboring building, causing a lot of damage. They were convicted at first instance although the court accepted that due to their age, they did not foresee the spread of the fire. The House of Lords, however, quashed the conviction, reinstating the law prior to Caldwell, which was overruled. Henceforward, in cases of criminal damage where the prosecution allege recklessness as the fault element, it must prove not merely that the risk was foreseeable, but that it actually was foreseen by the defendant.

Notice the huge difference between a consequence which is foreseeable, and one which was actually foreseen. Never get these mixed up. For crimes of recklessness, consequence must be foreseen. We've already learned this in the lecture on subjective and objective fault. There is one qualification to the requirement that the risk be actually foreseen by the defendant. That is where it is clear because it was so obvious that the risk of causing damage would have been foreseen by him if he had troubled to think about it.

This point was made in Parker. In this case, the defendant in anger smashed a public telephone down on its cradle causing it to break. He was convicted of criminal damage. On appeal, he claimed that he lacked mens rea because he was so angry at the time that the risk of causing damage to the telephone did not cross his mind. In other words, he didn't foresee it.

The Court of Appeal, upholding the conviction ruled that a person was reckless, not only when he was conscious of the risk he was running, but also if he closed his mind to the obvious fact that there is some risk of damage resulting from that act. In other words, you can know things are dangerous without thinking about it. Notice, closed mind recklessness does not apply to the young and inexperienced who simply did not foresee that what they were doing was risky.

The definition of recklessness provided in the draft code tells us that a person who consciously takes a risk of causing criminal damage is only to be considered reckless if the risk taken was an unreasonable risk to take in the circumstances. The court takes the following circumstances into account in deciding whether the risk taken was reasonable or unreasonable. First, the degree of risk. Secondly, the seriousness of the potential harm if the risk materializes. Thirdly, the social utility of the risk-taking.

If the defendant consciously takes a small risk of causing trivial damage for a socially acceptable reason, the jury should not find him to be reckless. On the other hand, if the defendant takes a big risk of causing serious criminal damage for a socially unacceptable reason, the jury should find him reckless. Matters will, of course, be more complicated for the jury when either of these extremes are not present. For example, first, there was a big risk of causing trivial damage for a socially acceptable reason or two, there was a small risk of causing serious damage for a socially acceptable reason.

To see how this might work in practice, let's look at a typical case of criminal damage, namely, damaging another's car. Take a look at case study one. To be guilty of criminal damage, the prosecution must show that the damage was done intentionally or recklessly. It is clearly not done intentionally, but is it done recklessly?

First, does it matter that he did not consider the risk? The answer is probably not. This is a case of closed mind recklessness. Second, was the risk and unreasonable risk to take? You the jury should say yes if you think that the likelihood of causing harm was so great and the harm threatened sufficiently serious as to offset his reason for taking the risk. What is his reason? We don't know. Here are two examples. First, I was late home for tea. Second, it was late at night and I was visiting my wife in hospital. The first reason is pretty weak. What about the second? Does this render his risk-taking reasonable?

Take a look now a case study two. Again, the damage is clearly not done intentionally but is it done recklessly? He has foreseen the risk but was it unreasonable for him to take this risk? In deciding this question, the jury will take into account the degree of risk. Here, it's pretty likely that some damage will be done. They will also take into account the amount of damage likely to materialize. Here, this is pretty trivial. Then consider whether this is offset by his reasons for taking the risk.

Is it? Well, this is what he'll probably say. "Do reasonable people think that I should have waited possibly for hours or walked the five miles home or taken a taxi at large expense, rather than do what I did, namely, take a risk of causing a very trivial harm to next door's car when, after all, he had boxed me in?"

It's the jury's call. As a juror, I would say his act was not reckless because it was not an unreasonable thing to do in the circumstances. I would have done it myself. Would you?

This case was an appeal to the ____________________________ for conviction of criminal damage In this case, two boys, aged 11 and 12, went camping without their parents' permission. The boys had set fire to some newspapers, the fire spread causing damage of over £1 million The boys had clearly fulfilled actus reus for the crime but the question was if they had                                     . At the time, the rest for recklessness was                              following the case of                     , and the boys age or understanding could not be t into account by the jury. They were                                  in lower courts of criminal damage and then appealed to House of Lords.

## 14.1 Simple criminal damage
### Attorney General's Reference No.1 of 2022 [2022] EWCA Crim 1259

This case concerns the concept of lawful excuse and damage to property during a protest. The question of lawful excuse in case of criminal damage gained a great deal of attention in 2020s, when during a Black Lives Matter protest in Bristol, a monument of 17th century slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down and thrown into the harbourside. Consequently, four of those involved were charged with criminal damage but acquitted by the jury after running several defences in the case of R v Ponsford, Willoughby, Graham and Skuse (Bristol Crown Court, 5 January 2022). The Colston Four, as the defendants were referred in media, argued, for example, the public display by the council of the Edward Colson statue was itself a crime as it was indecent and abusive and that they were entitled to use reasonable force to prevent such crime. Most notably, however, the defendants argued that the damage done to the statue was lawful because it was a proportionate exercise of the right to protest. The question of proportionality was important and referred to further consideration and clarity and resulted in Attorney General's Reference No. 1 of 2022.

In Attorney General's Reference No.1 of 2022, the Court of Appeal said that Articles 9, 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights do not provide protection to those who cause criminal damage during protest, which is violent or not peaceful. They concluded the toppling of the statue of Colston was not peaceful. In a ruling that will have a significant impact on future prosecution on damage to property inflicted during a protest, the Court of Appeal also concluded that prosecution and conviction for causing significant damage to property, even if inflicted in a way which is 'peaceful', could not be disproportionate in Convention terms.

Section 1(1) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 states:

A person who without lawful excuse destroys or damages any property belonging to another intending to destroy or damage any such property or being reckless as to whether any such property would be destroyed or damaged shall be guilty of an offence.

The maximum punishment for a violation of  $s.1(1)$  following a trial on indictment is 10 years' imprisonment  $(s.4(2))$ . Where the offence is committed by fire it will be charged as arson with a potential maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

### 14.1.1 Actus reus: simple criminal damage

As with theft, there are three elements of the *actus reus*.

- There must be property.
- That property must belong to another.
- D must damage that property.

#### Property

Property is defined in a similar way to property for the purpose of theft. However, it does not include things in action or intangible property, as these are immaterial and so cannot suffer physical damage. Another significant difference is that there are no restrictions regarding land or buildings. Indeed, the most common object of criminal damage, as in arson, is land and buildings.

 Section 10 states:

(1) in this Act 'property' means property of a tangible nature, whether real or personal, including money and:

(a) including wild creatures which have been tamed or are ordinarily kept in captivity, and any other wild creatures or their carcasses if, but only if, they have been reduced into possession which has not been lost or abandoned or are in the course of being reduced into possession; but

(b) not including mushrooms growing wild on any land or flowers, fruit or foliage of a plant growing wild on any land.

For the purposes of this subsection 'mushroom' includes any fungus and 'plant' includes any shrub or tree.

Criminal damage therefore includes damage to land, including cultivated plants and domesticated animals. A person who kills or injures a dog or cat, therefore, commits criminal damage. It includes damage to things on the land, whether or not they form part of the land. It also includes damage to personal property such as cars, vases, carpets, food, drink, paper, clothes and so on.

#### Destroys or damages property

'Destroys' adds nothing to 'damages', and so here we will consider what counts as damage. Where damage to premises is effected by fire, it may be charged as arson, which is a form of criminal damage. More broadly, any alteration to the physical nature of the property may amount to damage, depending on the circumstances, the nature of the property and the nature of the alteration. Whether property has been damaged is a question of fact for the magistrates or jury. In Morphitis v Salmon [1990] Crim LR 48, D dismantled a scaffold barrier across the road. D was acquitted of criminal damage to the bar component of the barrier. The court made the point that a

scratch on the bar of the barrier would not be damage, as it could not have impaired its value or usefulness, as scaffolding components get scratched in the normal course of events. This case shows that whether or not damage has occurred can be determined only by considering the object and the nature of the change wrought to it. If D had scratched a piece of furniture instead of a scaffold bar, the jury would no doubt have considered the damage element satisfied. Again, if he had been charged with damage to the barrier as a whole, by dismantling it, he might have been convicted. This is an example of the prosecution not wording the charge precisely enough.

#### **Study task 1**

- a. Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Chapter 17 'Criminal damage'. Note down as many different examples of criminal damage as you can find for future reference.
- b. Why, in Henderson and Battley (1984), was depositing 30 lorry loads of rubble on a building site criminal damage?
- c. Do you agree with the view in Smith and Hogan (2015) that wheel clamping should count as criminal damage, contrary to the decision in Drake v DPP (1994)?

Property belonging to another

By s.10(2) property for the purposes of the act belongs to any person:

(a) having the custody or control of it;

(b) having in it any proprietary right or interest (not being an equitable interest arising only from an agreement to transfer or grant an interest); or

(c) having a charge on it.

#### Section 10 goes on to state that

(3) Where property is subject to a trust, the persons to whom it belongs shall be so treated as including any person having a right to enforce the trust.

(4) Property of a corporation sole shall be treated as belonging to the corporation notwithstanding a vacancy in the corporation.

This provision bears comparison with the position with theft. The offence is committed only if the property damaged belongs to someone else. So the owner of property can commit criminal damage to that property if it also belongs to someone else in the sense provided by s.10. This would cover part-owners of real or personal

property, tenants or occupiers of land, and those in possession or control of real or personal property. So if, on the facts of Turner [1971] 1 WLR 901, D had damaged his car rather than taken it, he would have committed the actus reus of criminal damage.

Likewise, if a landlord damages the house let to their tenant, or vice versa, the *actus reus* is satisfied.

The key thing to notice here is that it is not (simple) criminal damage to damage one's own property, so long as it does not also belong to another in one of these senses. In Denton [1982] 1 All ER 65, D set fire to T's property at T's request, to perpetrate an insurance fraud. He was convicted at first instance but his conviction was later quashed. The insurance company had no proprietary interest in the property damaged and T was the sole owner, so could not be liable. As Lord Lane CJ said in this case: 'It is not an offence for a man to set light to his own property'. And if T was not liable, D could not be either because of the presence of T's consent, which, by s.5(2) Criminal Damage Act, is a defence.

### 14.1.2 Mens rea: simple criminal damage

The defendant must intend to damage property belonging to another or be reckless in respect of causing such damage. Intention carries its general meaning. The meaning of recklessness for the purposes of the Criminal Damage Act was for many years a matter of controversy until the House of Lords' decision in G [2003] UKHL 50, which returned recklessness to its previous (subjective) meaning. These states of mind were explained and discussed in Topic 5, and reference should be made to them.

Note: Remember that intention includes having damage as one's objective or foreseeing it as virtually certain. D is reckless if they recognised the risk of damage to property and nevertheless went on to take that risk unreasonably. Recklessness does not always require conscious awareness of the risk at the time of acting. It includes the case of someone who closes their mind to the risk (Parker [1977] 1 WLR 600, Booth v CPS [2006] EWHC 192 (Admin)).

It should be understood that legal principle requires mens rea to extend to every single aspect of the *actus reus*. This means that the prosecution must prove not merely that D intended damage to property (or was reckless as to such damage) but more specifically that they also intended to damage property belonging to another (or were reckless with regard to such damage). It is an answer to the charge, therefore, that D believed they were damaging their own property. In Smith [1974] QB 354, a tenant was found not guilty of damaging wiring in the apartment he was renting. He had installed it himself and this had led him to believe it belonged to him, not the lessor.

#### Lawful excuse

Section 1 of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 refers to damaging property without lawful excuse. Apart from the general defences, which will always be available, s.5 provides for two offence-specific defences. These are belief in the owner's consent and belief that it is necessary to protect one's own property.

Section 5 states:

(2) A person charged with an offence to which this section applies shall, whether or not he would be treated for the purposes of this Act as having a lawful excuse apart from this subsection, be treated for those purposes as having a lawful excuse-

(a) if at the time of the act or acts alleged to constitute the offence he believed that the person or persons whom he believed to be entitled to consent to the destruction of or damage to the property in question had so consented, or would have so consented to it if he or they had known of the destruction of or damage and its circumstances; or

(b) if he destroyed or damaged...the property in question...in order to protect property belonging to himself or another or a right or interest in property which was or which he believed to be vested in himself or another, and at the time of the act or acts alleged to constitute the offence he believed -

(i) that the property, right or interest was in immediate need of protection; and

(ii) that the means of protection adopted or proposed to be adopted were or would be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances.

Section 5 is the Criminal Damage Act 1971 equivalent of s.2 of the Theft Act 1968.

With respect to both of these lawful excuses it is enough that the belief was honestly held. There is no requirement that the belief be reasonable.

Belief in the consent of the person or persons believed to be entitled to consent

Usually, the person believed to be entitled to consent will be the owner, but not necessarily. It may include the owner's agent or manager or any other person D thinks has the power of consent.

Note: The person believed to be entitled to consent does not include God: an ingenious argument put forward by the defendant clergyman in Blake v DPP [1993] Crim LR 586 as a defence to a charge of damaging property by graffiti!

Section 5(2)(a) provided the defendant with his excuse in *Denton* (see Section 14.1.4). It also provided the defendant with her excuse in *Jaggard* v Dickinson [1981] QB 527. D, after an evening's drinking, found that she had been locked out of her home. She broke into a house which, in her drunken state, she thought belonged to a friend who would consent. In fact, she was mistaken; it was the house next door. The magistrates held that she could not rely upon s.5(2)(a), since her belief in consent was brought about by self-induced intoxication (see Topic 10). The Divisional Court quashed the conviction, relying on s.5(3), which states: 'For the purposes of this section it is immaterial whether a belief is justified or not if it is honestly held'.

 Mustill J said that:

the court is required by s.5(3) to focus on the existence of the belief, not its intellectual soundness; and a belief can be just as much honestly held if it is induced by intoxication, as if it stems from stupidity, forgetfulness or inattention.

Damaging property in order to protect a person's own property or an interest therein

The simplest case of  $s.5(2)(b)$  is where D damages property in order to protect their own property (e.g. shoots a dog worrying their sheep or sets fire to a haystack to prevent a fire on neighbouring land spreading to their house). The defence extends beyond property to property interests. So knocking down a wall blocking a right of way was held to be a lawful excuse in *Chamberlain* y Lindon [1998] 1 WLR 1252.

Section 5(2)(b) has been held to apply only where the damage done is for the direct and immediate purpose of protecting property. So, in Hunt (1978) 66 Cr App R 105, D argued that he set fire to a bed in an old people's home to draw attention to the non-working fire alarm. The Court of Appeal ruled that this was not a lawful excuse. D's action was taken not to protect the old people's home from damage but to act as a warning. In short, the act must be for the direct purpose of protecting property from harm.

The question of lawful excuse and damage to property has taken an interesting and more political turn in recent years. In 2022, the Attorney General made a reference to Court of Appeal to consider lawful excuse and protest in the case of Attorney General's Reference No.1 of 2022 [2022] EWCA Crim 1259. The question of lawful excuse in case of criminal damage gained a great deal of attention in 2020s when, during a Black Lives Matter protest in Bristol, a statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down and thrown into the harbour. Consequently, four of those involved were charged with criminal damage but acquitted by a jury after running several defences in R v Ponsford, Willoughby, Graham and Skuse (Bristol Crown Court, 5 January 2022). The Colston Four, as the defendants were referred to in media, argued, for example, the public display by the council of the Edward Colson statue was itself a crime as it was indecent and abusive and that they were entitled to use

reasonable force to prevent such a crime. Most notably, however, the defendants argued that the damage done to the statue was lawful because it was a proportionate exercise of the right to protest. The question of proportionality was important and was referred for further consideration and clarity. In Attorney General's Reference No.1 of 2022, the Court of Appeal said that Articles 9, 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights do not provide protection to those who cause criminal damage during a protest, which is violent or not peaceful. They concluded that the toppling of the statue of Colston was not peaceful. In a ruling that will have significant impact on future prosecutions on damage to property inflicted during a protest, the CA also concluded that prosecution and conviction for causing significant damage to property, even if inflicted in a way which is 'peaceful', could not be disproportionate in Convention terms.

## 14.2 Aggravated criminal damage

Section 1(2) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 states:

A person who without lawful excuse destroys or damages any property, whether belonging to himself or another-

(a) intending to destroy or damage any property or being reckless as to whether any property would be destroyed or damaged; and

(b) intending by the destruction or damage to endanger the life of another or being reckless as to whether the life of another would be thereby endangered;

shall be guilty of an offence.

Simple criminal damage is a property crime. Aggravated criminal damage, however, is a hybrid offence against property and against the person. Its core application is cases of dangerous arson. The kind of case covered by the aggravated offence is A-G's Reference (No 50 of 2005) [2005] EWCA Crim 2041, in which the defendant used petrol to set fire to his room in a hostel, in the hope that he would be rehoused. The hostel was destroyed. The aggravated offence was committed – D had committed arson and he was reckless as to whether life would be endangered by that arson.

Although dangerous arson is the usual fact scenario, the offence extends to all cases where, by damaging property, other people's lives are put at risk. Because it is designed to protect people from harm, this offence can be committed irrespective of whether the property damaged belongs to another.

### 14.2.1 Elements of the offence

- There must be intentional or reckless damage to property.
- The property does not have to belong to another person.
- The person must intend to endanger life by that damage, or be reckless as to whether life would be endangered by that damage.

The requirement that the risk to life must derive from the damage done to the property needs to be understood.

## Learning activity 2
