### **Introduction**

By contrast with failure of proof defences, affirmative defences operate outside the elements of the offence. The moral core of these defences is that the particular context within which the defendant was acting rendered their action permissible or excusable, although contrary to a criminal prohibition. In essence they adduce to the claim that the defendant reacted reasonably, or as reasonably as could be expected in the situation in which they were placed, either to allay the unjust threat of harm or otherwise to promote the common good. The defences we shall cover in this chapter are duress, duress of circumstances, necessity and self-defence. It is how these defences are distinguished which can cause difficulty.

**page 147**
### 11.1 Relationship between the defences**

It is easy to mix up the various affirmative defences as they all generally involve the claim that the defendant's action was necessary to avoid harm befalling them or someone else. It is important not to confuse them, however, not least because their scope is different. Duress, for example, is not a defence to murder but self-defence is. A brief outline of the usual coverage of these defences follows to show their essential points of difference.

Consider the following hypothetical case.

#### **Illustration 11.1**

**D threatens V with death unless V helps him to beat up X.**

- **a. If V succumbs to D's threat and does beat up X he may raise the defence of duress. Obedience to the criminal law does not demand a disproportionate personal sacrifice. Note the action taken by V is a wrong committed against an innocent person, which is excused as a concession to human frailty.**
- **b. If V resists the threat and attacks D, he may raise the defence of self-defence. The law permits people to protect themselves from those who would harm them. Note the action taken is not a wrong but a justified act of self-defence against the wrongdoer.**
- **c. If V escapes the threat by driving off at high speed the wrong way down a oneway street, he may raise the defence of duress of circumstances to a charge of dangerous driving. Again, the law does not demand a disproportionate personal sacrifice. Note the action taken is a wrong but this time it involves no victim. This wrong is excused.**
- **d. If V pushes X to the ground to prevent D delivering the first punch on X he may raise the defence of necessity. The criminal law accepts the moral imperative that people, faced with a crisis demanding immediate action, may embrace the lesser of two evils, even if that evil is non-conformity to the law. Note the action taken is not a wrong but a justified act designed to advance X's good and the common good.**

**In short, in response to the same threat, four different possible responses are available which may act as a defence to the charge levelled against V. These defences will now be looked at in turn.**

### **11.2 Public and private defence including self-defence**

The criminal law permits the use of reasonable force for the purpose of public or private defence. Section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 provides the basic template for both public and private defence. Section 3(1) reads:

(1) A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large.

Private defence, which is a subset of public defence, similarly permits the use of reasonable force in self-defence, defence of another or defence of property. To constitute defensive force, D must be acting defensively (i.e. not in retaliation or revenge) and the force used must be directed against a person posing an unjust threat and it must be used for the purpose of resisting that threat, in the case of private defence, or of preventing crime or making a lawful arrest in the case of public defence. So, in *R* v *Wilkinson* [2018] EWCA Crim 2154, the appellant, a taxi driver, was convicted of false imprisonment for having returned a passenger to where he had picked her up after she had informed him she was not intending to pay. He relied upon s.3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967, arguing that he had used reasonable force to prevent the passenger from committing a crime. His appeal was dismissed on two grounds. First,

**page 148**
refusing to pay, although wrongful, was not a crime. Secondly, even if it were a crime, his use of force in taking her back to the start of the journey did not prevent it from occurring. In effect, it was a retaliatory rather than a preventive measure. Similar reasoning informed *R* v *Demario Williams* [2020] EWCA Crim 193. The Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal against conviction of a youth who had killed in the course of trying to recover property that had been stolen from him. The Court said that the reasonable force was justified by s.3 where it was used to prevent a crime, such as theft or robbery, from occurring. It could not be utilised, as here, where it was used to recover property once that robbery or theft was completed. This was not within the coverage of s.3 of the CLA 1967.

Again, it is not available as a defence to a person **resisting** a lawful arrest since the arrest is not unjust. It is also not available to justify force used against an innocent person, such as V in Illustration 11.1 (a) or the sacrificed twin in *Re A (conjoined twins)* [2001] Fam 147, as neither is posing an unjust threat to the other. The correct defence in the first case is duress. The correct defence in *Re A* is one of necessity.

The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 has put some of the key common law principles on a statutory footing to ensure clarity and consistency of approach. They include a restatement of the rule that whether or not the use of force is lawful depends not on whether it was **in fact** necessary, but whether the defendant honestly believed it to be necessary. They include, also, guidelines on matters to be taken into account in deciding whether the degree of force used was reasonable. These consolidate the principles enunciated in *Beckford* [1988] AC 130. Section 76 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 (CJIA 2008) as amended by the Crime and Courts Act 2013 (s.43), which applies to all cases involving the use of force in public or private defence, provides as follows:

(3) The question whether the degree of force used by D was reasonable in the circumstances is to be decided by reference to the circumstances as D believed them to be.

Further:

- (4) If D claims to have held a particular belief as regards the existence of any circumstances –
  - (a) the reasonableness or otherwise of that belief is relevant to the question whether D genuinely held it; but
  - (b) if it is determined that D did genuinely hold it, D is entitled to rely on it for the purposes of subsection (3), whether or not –
    - (i) it was mistaken, or
    - (ii) (if it was mistaken) the mistake was a reasonable one to have made.
- (5) But subsection (4)(b) does not enable D to rely on any mistaken belief attributable to intoxication that was voluntarily induced.

Therefore, in a case such as *Beckford*, in which the defendant claimed that he used a gun because he believed he was being shot at, the jury must be asked: first, whether D might have honestly believed that he was being shot at; and, secondly, whether, on this assumption, D's use of the gun was proportionate to the perceived threat. The jury should also be directed that, if D's belief that he was under attack was unreasonable, this would be irrelevant as a matter of law but very relevant as a matter of evidence. The more preposterous D's supposed belief, the less likely it is that he actually held it. There are two qualifications to the 'circumstances as D believed them to be' principle. If, as in *Oye*, he is suffering from an insane delusion that he is being attacked and uses force to resist that attack, D's defence is one of insanity, not self-defence. See Section 10.3.1.

The second qualification is provided by s.76(5). Ths disentitles the defendant from relying on the defence if the mistake is attributable to self-induced intoxication. So a person who, through drink, mistakenly believes they are about to be attacked and uses force to repel the supposed attack is acting unlawfully, for which see discussion of *O'Connor*  at Section 10.5.1. It has been held recently that it is not necessary for the defendant to actually be intoxicated to be disentitled from relying on his mistaken belief. It is enough that the mistaken belief, as in *R* v *Taj,* was attributable to voluntary intoxication, as where recent alcohol abuse has resulted in a temporary, short-term psychotic episode. This case sits uneasily with *Oye*. For a discussion of *Taj*, see Section 10.5.1.

**page 149**
### **11.3 Meaning of 'reasonable force'**

Subsection 76(6) of the CJIA 2008 affirmed the common law position that the degree of force used by D is not to be regarded as having been reasonable in the circumstances as D believed them to be if it was disproportionate in those circumstances. Subsection 76(6) has now been amended to provide some extra protection to householders who overreact in the terror of discovering a burglar. For householders encountering an intruder, the question is not whether the degree of force is disproportionate but whether it is reasonable, which it may be so long as it is not 'grossly' disproportionate.

The common law provides that what is disproportionate is a question of degree. This means that the degree of force deemed reasonable varies according to the nature and degree of the threat. In *A-G's Reference (No 2 of 1983)* [1984] 2 WLR 465, it was held that a shopkeeper who armed himself with petrol bombs to protect his property from rioters was not acting disproportionately. However, a person protecting his property from burglars (*Martin* (*Anthony*) [2001] EWCA Crim 2245) or performing an arrest (*Clegg*  [1995] 1 AC 482, see below) will no doubt be acting disproportionately if he shoots to kill, but proportionately if he shoots to pre-empt a murderous attack on himself or another (*Beckford*). The case law contains the following guidance as to how to assess the reasonableness of the defender's response.

#### **11.3.1 Use of force must be necessary**

The use of force will not be reasonable if it is not immediately necessary (on the facts as D believed them to be). If, therefore, there are other defence options available, for example locking a door to prevent the intrusion of a burglar, the use of force may not be reasonable.

#### **11.3.2 No duty of retreat**

In *Field* [1972] Crim LR 435, D was told that V was coming round to attack him. D remained where he was and, in repelling V's attack, killed him. The prosecution case was that D's use of force was unreasonable since he had the opportunity to retreat and seek police protection. The Court of Appeal rejected this argument and allowed the defence.

#### **11.3.3 Provoking an attack**

A person is not disqualified from using reasonable force to defend themselves although they were originally at fault in provoking the attack. In *Rashford* [2005] EWCA Crim 3377, D mounted a revenge attack on V. V himself went on the attack, along with some friends. D then sought to defend himself and killed V. The Court of Appeal stated that the fact that D provoked the attack did not exclude his use of the defence. The defence was available so long as V's retaliation was of a nature to justify the use of force in selfdefence and if the violence used was not disproportionate to the perceived threat.

#### **11.3.4 Pre-emptive strike**

A person can make a pre-emptive strike so long as they honestly believe an attack to be imminent. This was made clear in the case of *A-G's Reference (No 2 of 1983),* considered above. It was said that the manufacture and storage of firebombs as a protective measure could negate liability for an offence amounting, in effect, to the possession of an explosive substance for an unlawful purpose. In *Beckford* (1988) Lord Griffith made the following statement of principle.

A man about to be attacked does not have to wait for his assailant to strike the first blow or fire the first shot; circumstances may justify a pre-emptive strike.

**page 150**
#### **11.3.5 Reasonable force decided objectively**

Whether the degree of force used is reasonable is decided objectively rather than from the defender's point of view. In deciding whether reasonable force was used, what matters is not whether D believed the amount of force used was reasonable, but whether it **was** reasonable. In deciding whether it was reasonable, the court must take into account the fact that D was acting under conditions of extreme stress, and so the jury must accept that under such conditions reasonable people may make errors of judgement (*Owino* (1996)). As Lord Morris said in *Palmer* v *R* [1971] AC 814: 'Detached reflection cannot be expected in the face of an uplifted knife'.

Section 76 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 enshrines this approach. Section 76(6) provides that:

(6) The degree of force used by D is not to be regarded as having been reasonable in the circumstances as D believed them to be if it was disproportionate in those circumstances.

In deciding whether it was disproportionate, s.76(7) says:

the following considerations are to be taken into account (so far as relevant in the circumstances of the case) –

that a person acting for a legitimate purpose may not be able to weigh to a nicety the exact measure of any necessary action; and

that evidence of a person's having only done what the person honestly and instinctively thought was necessary for a legitimate purpose constitutes strong evidence that only reasonable action was taken by that person for that purpose.

Notice, however, that the defender's honest and instinctive belief is only evidential. It cannot override the requirement that the degree of force used must be proportionate to the threat. In *R* v *Clegg*, a private soldier serving with the Parachute Regiment in West Belfast fired four shots into an oncoming car at a road block. The final shot killed a passenger in the back seat. D's defence was that he had fired because he had thought that a colleague's life was in danger. In relation to the first three shots the judge had accepted that D may have fired in self-defence or in defence of his colleague. However, the fourth shot had been fired at the car after it had passed. It could no longer, therefore, ground the defence of self-defence since the danger had passed. Any use of force thus became automatically unreasonable, whatever D's degree of stress and whatever he honestly and instinctively believed.

Again, in *R* v *Martin*, D shot dead a burglar because he overestimated the danger to which he was subject. He may have done so due to a psychiatric disorder. The Court of Appeal, upholding D's conviction, restated the rule that the question as to how much force is lawful is a question of law and is an objective question. D's honest assessment of the degree of force necessary was not decisive. It could not be objectively reasonable to shoot a burglar in the absence of any evidence of physical threat, however scared he was.

A similar result occurred in *Yaman* [2012] EWCA Crim 1075. The Court held that, even if it was assumed that in attacking a court-appointed locksmith with a hammer, D had mistakenly 'done what he honestly and instinctively thought was necessary' to resist a supposed burglary on the family shop, the jury must still inevitably have concluded that the force he used was excessive.

Both *Yaman* and *Martin* illustrate the kind of problems likely to arise when householders are unexpectedly confronted with an intruder. In 2013, the Government made another attempt to ensure that public perceptions of the scope of the defence corresponded with the legal underpinnings. This time, however, the change is one of substance rather than language. Section 43 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 adds a new subs.(5A) to s.76 of the CJIA 2008. The effect of subs.(5A) is to apply a more flexible standard of reasonableness of reaction to the householder (e.g. Tony Martin), than for the defence generally (e.g. Private Clegg), to give **householders** 'greater latitude in terrifying or extreme situations where they may not be thinking clearly about the precise level of force that is necessary to deal with the threat faced.' (Ministry of Justice circular). Subsection 5A provides:

**page 151**
*In a householder case, the degree of force used by D is not to be regarded as having been reasonable in the circumstances as D believed them to be if it was grossly disproportionate in those circumstances.*

The effect of subs.(5A) is that, if householders act honestly and instinctively to protect themselves or their family from intruders using force that was reasonable in the circumstances as they saw them, they will not necessarily be guilty of an offence even if the level of force turns out to have been disproportionate in those circumstances. In *R (Collins)* v *The Secretary of State for Justice* [2016] EWHC 33 (Admin) Collins was tackled by a householder while intruding in his house. The householder put him in a headlock which caused serious injury from which Collins was not expected to recover. The question for the court was whether subs.(5A) had the effect of rendering any use of force other than grossly disproportionate force, reasonable force. The Queen's Bench Divisional Court ruled that, while grossly disproportionate force cannot be reasonable and so is unlawful, if the force used is disproportionate without being grossly disproportionate, it may or may not be reasonable. The decision is for the jury, taking into account all the householder's circumstances. In *R* v *Ray* [2017] EWCA Crim 1391 the Court of Appeal approved this approach. Whether, despite being disproportionate, it is reasonable or not is a matter for the jury, taking into account the context and all the circumstances.

By subs.(8B) the definition of a householder covers people who live in dwellings and also buildings which serve a dual purpose as a place of residence and a place of work (for example, a shopkeeper and their family who live above the shop). In these circumstances, the 'householders' can rely on the more generous defence regardless of which part of the building they were in when they were confronted by an intruder.

##### **Activity 11.1**

**Read Wilson, Section 13.5.A.2(a)(ii) 'The qualifying triggers' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. How might Clegg now expect to be able to avoid a conviction for murder?**
- **b. Does the new test put too much power in the hands of the householder?**

### **11.4 Scope of private defence**

As we have seen, self-defence is available to all crimes involving the use of force, including physical force and pre-emptive force. It is even a defence to murder. Some concern has been voiced in this regard in relation to the actions of law enforcement agencies, such as the police. The 'honest belief' requirement in the need to use force has on occasions led to dubious acquittals of police officers who shoot to kill, without taking sufficient steps to determine whether the circumstances truly demand defensive action. This seems to be contrary to Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights which guarantees the right to life and permits fatal violence for defensive purposes only if it is 'absolutely necessary'. If D shoots V, believing V to be taking out a gun from his pocket when in fact it is his identification papers, the killing is hardly 'absolutely necessary', but the 'honest belief' requirement nevertheless acquits D.

Public and private defence is only available to crimes involving the use of force. This means it is not available where the crime committed to escape an unlawful threat of harm does not involve the use of force, for example, simple driving offences and most cases of criminal damage, theft or fraud. D must therefore bring his case within another defence to avoid liability. So public defence would not be available for a person, who, as a means of bringing a fugitive to justice (public defence), paints the latter's name and address on a police station wall, since graffiti does not constitute force. It would be different if A broke a window so as to be able to defend V, who was being attacked on the other side by D, or locked D in a room to prevent D attacking V.

**page 152**
Here, force – breaking a window or imprisoning someone involves force – is being used for defensive purposes. Likewise a person who, in order to escape a threatened attack, drives the wrong way down a one-way street or otherwise drives dangerously cannot rely on self-defence but would need to bring her defence within the more restricted scope of duress of circumstances. It should be remembered that even driving offences may be brought within the scope of private defence if they involve the use of force. So in *R* v *Riddell* [2017] EWCA Crim 413 the defendant, having been pursued in her car by another driver and brought to a stop, sought to escape a threatened attack by nudging the pursuer aside with her car. On a charge of dangerous driving, the trial judge did not put the defence of self-defence to the jury. Instead, he directed them in relation to the defence of duress of circumstances whose elements were less favourable to the defence. The jury convicted. The defendant's appeal was successful. What she had done in response to the perceived threat – using her car to nudge the pursuer out of the way – involved the use of force and so the defence was applicable.

### **11.5 Duress**

#### **11.5.1 General matters**

Duress is a rather unusual defence in that it involves the claim that it may be excusable to follow the commands of a wrongdoer rather than the state, and that it may be excusable to victimise an innocent person to save one's own skin. Therefore the defence is hedged around with restrictions. Reasonableness of reaction is of the essence for this defence since it is one of the criminal law's few concessions to human frailty. An account of the defence was expressed by Murnaghan J in *A-G* v *Whelan* [1934] IR 518 (Irish CCA) as:

...threats of immediate death or serious personal violence so great as to overbear the ordinary powers of human resistance should be accepted as a justification for acts which would otherwise be criminal.

There are two forms of duress: **duress by threats** and **duress of circumstances**. In duress by threats, D is coerced into committing an unlawful act by the threats of a wrongdoer. In duress of circumstances, D is compelled to commit an unlawful act to avoid a threat of harm posed by external circumstances.

##### **Illustration 11.2**

- **a. X puts a gun to the head of D, a taxi driver, and says 'Get me to the airport in five minutes or I kill you'. D exceeds the speed limit in acceding to this demand.**
- **b. D notices that the driver in the car behind him has lost consciousness. At any moment, the out-of-control car will crash into D's car at high speed. D goes through a red traffic light in order to avoid the crash.**

In the first case, D may rely on the defence of duress by threats. In the second case, D's defence is one of duress of circumstances.

The basic principles governing duress were expounded in *Graham* [1982] 1 WLR 294. These have been subsequently approved by the House of Lords in *Howe* [1987] AC 417 and held applicable also to duress of circumstances in *Martin* [1989] 1 All ER 652. In *Graham* the defendant lived in a *ménage à trois* with W, his wife, and K, his homosexual lover. One night, after D and K had been drinking heavily, K put a lighting flex round

**page 153**
W's neck and then commanded D to pull at the other end. D did so and his wife was strangled. Both D and K were charged with murder. D pleaded not guilty, claiming that his action was coerced by his fear of K. Although the judge allowed the defence to go to the jury, it convicted D of murder. The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction. Lord Lane CJ proposed the following model direction as guidance to the jury.

Was the accused, or may he have been, impelled to act as he did because as a result of what he reasonably believed to be the situation he feared that otherwise death or serious injury would result; second, if so, would a sober person of reasonable firmness, sharing the characteristics of the accused, have responded to the situation by acting as the accused did?

##### **Activity 11.3**

**The above quotation encapsulates the basic principle governing both forms of duress. Commit it to memory.**

**Why is illustration 11.2(b) not a case of self-defence?**

**No feedback provided.**

#### **11.5.2 Duress by threats**

These principles have suffered significant elaboration more recently by the House of Lords in the case of *Hasan* [2005] UKHL 22. In this case, in which the defendant pleaded duress by threats by X, a violent man with whom he had a criminal association, in answer to his trial for aggravated burglary, Lord Bingham placed the following restrictions upon its application as a defence. It seems likely that these principles, with the possible exception of 2, apply equally to duress of circumstances.

- 1. The threat or danger must be of death or serious injury.
- 2. The threat must be directed against the defendant, his or her immediate family or someone close to the defendant.
- 3. The relevant tests are in general objective, with reference to the reasonableness of the defendant's perceptions and conduct.
- 4. The defence is available only where the criminal conduct which it is sought to excuse has been directly caused by the threats relied upon.
- 5. There must have been no evasive action the defendant could reasonably have been expected to take.
- 6. The defendant must not voluntarily have laid themself open to the duress relied upon.
- 7. Duress may be a defence to any crime except some forms of treason, murder and attempted murder.

##### **Activity 11.4**

**Commit the seven restrictions on the defence of duress outlined in** *Hasan* **to memory.**

**1. The threat or danger must be of death or serious injury**

The essence of this defence is that the defendant's actions were morally involuntary, and only threats of death or serious injury remove the element of free choice. So in *Valderrama-Vega* [1985] Crim LR 220, the Court of Appeal ruled that the threat of exposing D's homosexuality was not enough to raise the defence. Again, the Court of Appeal in *Quayle* [2005] EWCA Crim 1415 ruled that duress of circumstances was not an answer to a charge under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 for a defendant who claimed he had consumed cannabis to combat severe neurological pain following a leg amputation. Severe pain does not amount to serious injury.

One extremely significant qualification to this restriction was made in *A (RJ)* [2012] EWCA Crim 434 where it was stated *obiter* that a credible threat of rape could ground the defence of duress or duress of circumstances.

**page 154**
##### **Activity 11.5**

**Read** *Dao* **[\[2012\] EWCA Crim 1717.](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2012/1717.html) Can false imprisonment or the threat of false imprisonment ground the defence of duress?**

**2. The threat must be directed against the defendant, his or her immediate family or someone for whom the defendant reasonably regards himself as being responsible**

Duress is not limited to cases where the defendant is the subject of the threats. It also applies where his or her partner (*Hurley* v *Murray* [1967] VR 526), spouse or family is the subject (*Ortiz* (1986) 83 Cr App R 173). Until *Hasan* there was no strong authority for the proposition that the availability was limited to those with a close personal connection to the defendant. In *Shayler* [2001] EWCA Crim 1977, the defendant, a member of the security services, in passing documents to journalists breached the Official Secrets Act which, it was alleged, he had done in order to safeguard members of the public. At a preliminary hearing the judge ruled that the defence of duress of circumstances was not available to Shayler. His appeal was dismissed on the ground that he was unable to pinpoint with any degree of precision what the threats to security might involve or who was at risk. Lord Woolf limited the application of the defence to cases where:

a defendant commits an otherwise criminal act to avoid an imminent peril of danger to life or serious injury to himself or towards somebody for whom he reasonably regards himself as being responsible.

Lord Woolf included among that class not merely members of the defendant's close circle but also cases where:

he is placed in a position where he is required to make a choice whether to take or not to take the action which it is said will avoid them being injured. Thus if the threat is to explode a bomb in a building if the defendant does not accede to what is demanded the defendant owes responsibility to those who would be in the building if the bomb exploded.

It is clear that this class of subjects is far wider than that proposed by Lord Bingham in *Hasan*, and – for the reasons given by Lord Woolf – rightly so. An emergency is no less an emergency for the fact that the individuals threatened are not known personally to the defendant.

##### **Activity 11.6**

**A tells B on the day of the trial that if he does not perjure himself C, A's gang member, has been given instruction to select and kill an unidentified child. Assuming B commits perjury, what problem will the defence have in raising the defence of duress? What argument would you make to advance the defence's case?**

**3. The relevant tests are in general objective, with reference to the reasonableness of the defendant's perception and conduct**

*Hasan* confirms Lord Lane CJ's statement in *Graham* that if D acts under a mistaken belief that he, or someone for whom he is responsible, has been threatened with death or serious injury, the mistake will not avail him unless it is reasonable. Compare self-defence on this point. The decision in *Shayler*, for example, could equally have been decided on the ground that there was no plausible case appearing in the leaked documents that members of the public were at imminent risk of death or serious injury. D may have believed they were but the belief was not held on reasonable grounds.

In *A (RJ)* [2012] EWCA Crim 434, the defendant was convicted of the offence of perverting the course of justice when she falsely retracted allegations of rape against her husband. She did so, apparently, in the belief that she would suffer serious injury by her husband if she did not. This fear was real but not based on reasonable grounds since no threat of violence had been made to her when she made the false retractions on which her prosecution was founded.

**page 155**
The criminal law does not give *carte blanche* to a person threatened with death or serious injury to commit any crime demanded of them. Indeed, as we shall see, duress is never a defence to murder or attempted murder, however powerful the threats. But, more generally, a reasonable balance must be struck between the threat posed to the defendant and the crime they must commit to avoid the threat. Although D is faced with a threat of death or grievous bodily harm, it may still be necessary for them to do their legal duty. Although there is authority for the proposition that duress of circumstances may be an answer to a charge of hijacking an aircraft (*Abdul Hussain* [1999] Crim LR 570), it might be that the jury concludes that participating in this crime is not objectively reasonable, however serious the threats.

As *Graham* provides, moreover, reasonable standards of courage are required. In deciding whether the defendant did display the standards of fortitude of reasonable people, it will not avail D to claim that they were a congenital coward. So in *Hegarty* [1994] Crim LR 353, the defendant pleaded duress to a charge of robbery and possession of a firearm. He claimed that he had been threatened with violence against his family if he refused. The court refused to allow medical evidence that D was 'emotionally unstable' and in a 'grossly elevated neurotic state' to vary the standards of fortitude to be expected of him. And in *Bowen* [1997] 1 WLR 372, the defendant's very low level of intelligence was similarly ignored on the basis that reasonable courage can be expected of everyone, including those with severe learning difficulties.

However, some characteristics of the defendant which may affect the levels of fortitude to be expected of reasonable people may be taken into account, so long as they are consistent with a coherent notion of a reasonable person. The legal position is summed up in the following statement of principle of Stuart Smith LJ in *Bowen*.

The mere fact that the defendant is more pliable, vulnerable, timid or susceptible to threats than a normal person is not a characteristic with which it is legitimate to invest the reasonable/ordinary person for the purpose of considering the objective test… The defendant may be in a category of persons whom the jury may think less able to resist pressure than people not within that category. Obvious examples are age, where a young person may well not be so robust as a mature one; possibly sex, though many women would doubtless consider they had as much moral courage to resist pressure as men; pregnancy, where there is added fear for the unborn child; serious physical disability, which may inhibit self protection…

One further qualification needs to be made with respect to this rather rigorous restriction; namely that where a reasonable person has been reduced, through trauma such as cumulative domestic violence or rape (*Sewell* [2004] EWCA Crim 2322), to a condition of 'learned helplessness' and so unable to resist the threats of their abuser, this should be taken into account. Society cannot expect reasonable people to be steadfast in the face of unremitting physical and mental abuse.

##### **Activity 11.7**

- **a. Is** *Hegarty* **(1994) reconcilable with the case of** *Emery* **(1993), discussed in Wilson, Section 10.4.C 'A part subjective and part objective test'?**
- **b. Can you think of any offences for which it might reasonably be concluded that taking part in the offence, even under threat of death, would not be reasonable?**

**4. The defence is available only where the criminal conduct which it is sought to excuse has been directly caused by the threats relied upon**

It is not enough that the defendant was threatened with death or serious injury for non-compliance with the threat; they must execute or participate in the crime because of the threat. If D would have committed the crime anyway, the defence is unavailable. In *Valderrama* [1985] Crim LR 220, for example, the defendant was threatened both with exposure as a homosexual and threats to himself and his family if he did not smuggle cocaine. The Court of Appeal said that if D had committed the offence solely because of the threat to expose him as a homosexual, then he would not be able to rely on duress, even though he had also been threatened with death. However, if he had committed the offence at least in part due to the latter threat the defence would be available.

**page 156**
**5. There must have been no evasive action the defendant could reasonably have been expected to take**

Consistent with the requirement that D's participation in the offence must be an objectively reasonable means of allaying a threat of death or serious injury, the defence is not available if it could have been avoided, whether by escaping the coercer or seeking police protection. So in *Gill* [1963] 1 WLR 841, D was convicted of the theft of his employer's lorry. The Court of Appeal held that duress was not available where the defendant had been left alone outside his employer's yard, which he was due to rob, and therefore was well able to raise the alarm and escape the threat.

In *Hudson and Taylor* [1971] 2 QB 202, the Court of Appeal was not so exacting. The defendants were teenage girls who were prosecution witnesses in the trial of certain gang members. The gang threatened to 'cut them up' if they did not perjure themselves in court. They pleaded duress. The trial judge refused to allow the defence since the threat could hardly have been carried out immediately in open court. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, agreeing that seeking police protection was not always reasonably to be expected.

In *Hasan* the House of Lords has now abandoned this relaxed approach to the requirement of urgency in duress. Lord Bingham, disapproving *Hudson and Taylor*, insisted that the defence was not available unless D reasonably apprehended immediate or almost immediate death or serious injury for failure to comply. If this were not the case, D would be expected to take evasive action.

##### **Activity 11.8**

**Read Wilson, Section 10.4.D 'Immediacy of the threat' and answer the following question.**

**How is the abandonment of the approach in** *Hudson and Taylor* **reconcilable with the principle in (3) above that the court should bear in mind matters such as age, sex and physical health in deciding whether D could reasonably have been expected to resist the threat?** 

**6. The defendant must not voluntarily have laid themself open to the duress relied upon**

**Intoxication**

Once again, this requirement is a qualification of the general requirement of reasonableness which hedges round the defence. There are two aspects to this qualification. First, as *Graham* provides, loss of moral fortitude due to the effects of voluntary intoxication cannot be relied upon. The jury should be told to disregard any evidence of the defendant's intoxicated state when assessing whether they acted under duress. The reasonable person is sober and steadfast, not drunk and out of control. This does not prevent the defendant from raising evidence of intoxication to negate *mens rea*. Defence counsel did not present such an argument in *Graham*.

##### **Activity 11.9**

**Read Wilson, Section 9.11.D 'Intoxicated mistakes' and answer the following question. Would the position be any different if the intoxication was involuntary?** 

**Voluntary subjection to the risk of coercion**

The defence is also denied to those who voluntarily place themselves at risk of coercion. This is another example of the doctrine of prior fault. In *Sharpe* [1987] QB 853, the defendant joined a criminal gang. He later participated in a robbery on a Post Office, in which a sub-postmaster was killed. D's defence to manslaughter was duress: he claimed that he had undertaken the robbery only because he had a gun to his head. The defence was rejected upon the basis that D voluntarily joined the gang, knowing that coercion might later be brought to bear to commit an offence. In *Hasan* [2005] UKHL 22, the House of Lords stated that the defendant is disqualified from relying on the defence not only where they actually foresee that violence may be used to exact compliance, but also where they should reasonably know that it may be.

**page 157**
The rule applies equally where the defendant voluntarily runs the risk of coercion outside the scope of a criminal organisation. In *Heath* [2000] Crim LR 109, a drug user who was coerced into supplying a class B drug by his own supplier who he had not paid was denied the defence on the basis that he should have known the risks of mixing with drug dealers. A similar decision was reached in *Mullally* [2012] EWCA Crim 687.

**7. Duress may be a defence to any crime except some forms of treason, murder and attempted murder**

Until fairly recently, duress could be raised in answer to a charge of murder but only where the defendant was an accessory to, rather than perpetrator of, the murder. This was the outcome of *DPP for Northern Ireland* v *Lynch* [1975] AC 653 in which the defendant, as driver, had participated in the murder of a police officer by the IRA. D's defence was duress, claiming the coercer would have shot him if he did not comply. The trial judge disallowed the defence and the Court of Appeal dismissed D's appeal. The House of Lords, underlining the rationale of the defence as a concession to human frailty, allowed the appeal. Lord Morris, explaining the decision, said:

any rational system of law should take fully into account the standards of honest and reasonable men. By those standards it is fair that actions and reactions may be tested. If then someone is really threatened with death or serious injury unless he does what he is told to do is the law to pay no heed to the miserable, agonising plight of such a person? For the law to understand not only how the timid but also the stalwart may in a moment of crisis behave is not to make the law weak but to make it just. In the calm of the courtroom measures of fortitude or of heroic behaviour are surely not to be demanded when they could not in moments for decision reasonably have been expected even of the resolute and the well disposed.

In posing the case where someone is 'really' threatened I use the word 'really' in order to emphasise that duress must never be allowed to be the easy answer of those who can devise no other explanation of their conduct nor of those who readily could have avoided the dominance of threats nor of those who allow themselves to be at the disposal and under the sway of some gangster-tyrant…The law would be censorious and inhumane which did not recognise the appalling plight of a person who perhaps suddenly finds his life in jeopardy unless he submits and obeys.

In *Howe* [1987] AC 417, two appellants, H and B, were coerced by X into torturing and murdering a young man. The House of Lords dismissed their appeals against conviction and, overruling *Lynch*, said that it could be used neither by the principal nor the accessory. Lord Hailsham LC, ignoring the 'human frailty' basis of the defence, made it an issue rather of moral reasonableness. A reasonable person does not kill another to save their own skin, a principle which had earlier been used in the necessity case of *Dudley and Stephens* (1884) 14 QBD 273.

[In the case] where the choice is between the threat of death or… serious injury and deliberately taking an innocent life… a reasonable man might reflect that one innocent human life is at least as valuable as his own or that of his loved one. In such a case a man cannot claim that he is choosing the lesser of two evils. Instead he is embracing the cognate but morally disreputable principle that the end justifies the means.

In *Gotts* [1992] 2 AC 412, the restriction was extended to attempted murder. In this case, D was coerced by his father into helping him to kill his mother. The Court of Appeal ruled that the defence of duress was not available. It has been decided, however, that duress is an answer to conspiracy to murder (*Ness* [2011] EWCA Crim 3105).

##### **Activity 11.10**

**Read Wilson, Section 10.4.F 'Scope of the defence' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. Which approach do you prefer,** *Howe* **or** *Lynch***?**
- **b. The House of Lords refused to allow the defence to either principal or accessory. Is this fair?**

**page 158**
- **c. Is it cogent to distinguish between the relative contributions of principal and accessory? If so, you might be interested in knowing that in** *Howe* **the coercer did not execute the killing and so he was the accessory.**
- **d. Can you think of a situation where it would definitely be unfair to disallow the defence to an accessory?**
- **e. If D intentionally commits grievous bodily harm to V under coercion D is entitled to raise the defence. If V happens to die due to poor medical treatment, D will be charged with murder and so will not be able to raise the defence. Is this coherent?**
- **f. If not, should duress be withdrawn from s.18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861?**

**No feedback provided.**

### **11.6 Duress of circumstances**

In 1986 the defence of duress was allowed in a number of cases involving dangerous driving and other driving offences, although the crime to be committed was not nominated by the wrongdoer; it was nominated by the driver himself as a means of escaping the wrongdoer's threat of death or serious injury. In *Willer* (1986) 83 Cr App R 225, duress was allowed as an answer to a charge of reckless driving when D drove through a pedestrian precinct to escape from a gang threatening violence to him and his passengers. This was not, in itself, a substantial departure from precedent. After all, there is little difference between A saying to V 'drive through this pedestrian precinct or else I shoot you' and A threatening to shoot V, in response to which A drives off through a pedestrian precinct. If the one excuse is available, the other should be too.

A similar decision was reached in *Conway* [1989] QB 290, except that here D mistakenly believed he was being attacked by a gang when in fact they were plain clothes police officers trying to make an arrest on his passenger. You will remember that the defence remains available even if D is mistaken as to the facts, so long as the mistake is reasonable.

*Martin* [1989] 1 All ER 652 was the first case in which it was explicitly recognised that duress of circumstances was a separate form of the defence in which it was not necessary to show that the defendant acted so as to escape the threats of a person bent on killing or causing serious injury to them or a companion. Here, D drove his stepson, who had overslept, to work although he was a disqualified driver. D had been told by his wife that if he did not do so the stepson would lose his job and she would commit suicide. The Court of Appeal ruled that the trial judge was wrong in not allowing the defence of duress of circumstances to be put to the jury.

In *Pommell* [1995] 2 Cr App R 607, the defence was made available for the first time to a case not involving a driving offence. D was charged and convicted of being in possession of a loaded machine gun. D claimed that he had taken possession of it to prevent the owner shooting to kill and was intending to take it to the police the next day. In *S and L* [2009] EWCA Crim 85, duress of circumstances was ruled available to a charge of employing unlicensed security guards as a means of addressing the risk of terrorist attack on their premises which abutted a public highway.

**Note 1:** The cases dealt with above all involved 'crimes without victims', i.e. no one was victimised by the defendant's decision to escape danger by breaking the law. Does it operate where an innocent person is victimised? In *R* v *Petgrave* [2018] EWCA Crim 1397, the Court of Appeal affirmed that it would in a case where the defendant was charged with causing serious injury by dangerous driving, contrary to s.1A of the Road Traffic Act 1988, when he had mounted the pavement and injured the victim in trying to escape from a dangerous gang.

**page 159**
**Note 2**: *Pommel, Martin* and *S and L*, to a greater extent than *Conway* and *Willer*, involved subtle changes to the conceptual DNA of the defence of duress. The defendant is not merely saying 'I broke the law to escape D causing me or someone else serious injury' but rather 'I did it because it was the lesser of two evils. If I had not broken the law a worse evil would have occurred'. In other words, it transcends the usual rationale for duress which is that it acts as a concession to human frailty. It takes on the trappings of a partial justification rather than a mere excuse and begins to transmute into a defence of necessity.

### **11.7 Necessity**

The potential scope of necessity was described in the Canadian case of *Perka* v *Queen* (1984) 13 DLR (4th) as:

Necessity covers all cases where non-compliance with the law is excused by an emergency or justified by the pursuit of some greater good.

#### **11.7.1 Necessity as an excuse**

The recognition of the defence of duress of circumstances was in effect a recognition of a general defence of necessity, a defence which had long been resisted by the criminal courts. In fact, *Petgrave* notwithstanding, there is little in present case law to suggest that duress of circumstances will develop to embrace the same coverage as duress by threats. As we know, duress by threats is an answer even to crimes of violence where an innocent is victimised. Duress of circumstances, by contrast, has usually been applied in so-called victimless crimes. Indeed, the leading case on necessity (*Dudley and Stephens* (1884)) explicitly rejected any defence of necessity which would permit 'the killing of an innocent to save one's own skin'. As a result, two shipwrecked sailors, who killed and ate the cabin boy after days adrift in an open boat, had no answer to a charge of murder.

It was this case and this principle which led Lord Hailsham in *Howe* to disallow the defence of duress by threats in cases of murder. Until *Willer* and *Conway* the courts, using *Dudley and Stephens* as authority, consistently refused to allow this 'lesser of two evils' defence. There were two reasons given for this. The first, as illustrated by *Dudley and Stephens* itself, was that it would introduce the potential for individual rights to be overridden by collective interests. If those defendants had a defence, would it not also afford a defence to doctors and others who effected forced blood transfusions or organ transplants if this accorded with the balance of evils?

The second reason is that such a defence would subvert the rule of law since it could, in effect, allow individuals to ignore their legal duty in the pursuit of some supposedly greater good. On balance it might be considered better to allow the State to sort out problems needing solution rather than leaving it to individual choice. So in *Buckoke*  v *GLC* [1971] Ch 655, the Court of Appeal held that it was no answer to a charge of jumping a red traffic light that the driver was in a fire engine answering an emergency. And in *Southwark LBC* v *William*s [1971] Ch 734, it was no answer to trespass that the trespassers were homeless and the building unoccupied. In this case, Lord Denning gave a classic illustration of a 'floodgates' argument in the context of the threat to the rule of law posed by a potential defence of necessity.

…if hunger were once allowed to be an excuse for stealing, it would open a way through which all kinds of disorder and lawlessness would pass…If homelessness were once admitted as a defence to trespass, no one's house could be safe. Necessity would open a door which no man could shut. It would not only be those in extreme need who would enter. There would be others who would imagine that they were in need, or would invent a need, so as to gain entry.

The real significance of the acceptance of the defence of duress of circumstances must be considered in the light of this statement, since it provides an answer to Lord Denning's concerns. The defence is limited to cases of emergency when something has to be done immediately to prevent harm and there is no opportunity to seek guidance or state protection. And it is limited to cases where the harm threatened is of death or serious injury. The defendant, in other words, is not simply choosing a breach of the law as the lesser of two evils: rather, the nature of the emergency gives him no choice.

**page 160**
The scoping statement provided in *Perka* is only partly covered by duress of circumstances, since the latter does not legitimate action taken in defiance of a criminal prohibition simply because it would be the lesser of two evils. Applied to a case such as *Buckoke* v *GLC*, a defence is now available if the fire engine jumped the red traffic lights in the reasonable belief that it was necessary to prevent loss of life, but it would remain unlawful to do so simply to facilitate the putting out of the fire and thus reduce the extent of fire damage and the resources necessary to effect this.

#### **11.7.2 Necessity as a justification**

The justificatory form of necessity outlined in *Perka* has now been accepted by the courts in one restricted context, namely medical intervention. There is a good reason for this – that if the case is not an emergency, doctors generally have the ability to secure legal authority for their action by an application to the High Court.

The first case of this nature was *Re F* [1990] 2 AC 1. Doctors in a mental hospital sought a declaration that it would be lawful for them to perform a sterilisation operation on a mentally incompetent (female) patient who had formed a sexual relationship with a fellow patient. The House of Lords concluded that it was in her overall 'best interests' for the operation to proceed on a balance of all her interests, including her interest in remaining free from the physical and psychological effects of pregnancy, abortion or childbirth on the one hand, and her interest in having procreative capacity and remaining free from surgical interference on the other. Lord Goff, for the House of Lords, underlined its justificatory nature by stating that it was not of the essence that there be some emergency requiring immediate action, although in many cases this would be present. Operations and other interventions may be justified even if performed for other than clinical reasons. He said:

these might include such humdrum matters as routine medical or dental treatment, even simple care such as dressing and undressing and putting to bed.

The availability of the defence does not, however, depend upon authority being sought. In *Bournewood* [1999] 1 AC 458, the defence was allowed *ex post fact*o to justify the detention of a patient suffering a mental disorder and whose condition posed a potential threat to himself and others.

These cases were not exceptional on the facts, since they involved mentally incompetent patients whose wellbeing depended upon the availability of such a defence. In other words, their human rights were supposedly being advanced, rather than trampled on, by the defence. The defence does not, however, justify doctors acting contrary to a competent patient's express wishes, for example performing a life-saving caesarean section (*St George's Healthcare NHS Trust* v *S* [1998] 3 All ER 673) or leg amputation (*Re C* [1994] 1 All ER 819) on a patient who refuses consent.

In *Re A (Conjoined Twins)* [2001] Fam 147, the defence of necessity was used to justify an operation to separate conjoined twins who shared a heart. The necessity for the operation was that without it, both twins would quickly die. The problem, however, was that the inevitable consequence of the operation would be the immediate death of the twin lacking a heart and that was hardly in her best interests! Would the proposed operation be lawful in the light of this? Doctrine holds that intentional acts calculated to produce certain death is murder, and duress of circumstances is no defence to murder. If necessity was to operate as a defence here, therefore, it would have to be, like self-defence, in its justificatory form. Brooke LJ (at 1052) explicitly adopted the justificatory lesser of two evils basis for the defence in the following statement of principle. The defence would be limited to cases where:

-  the act is needed to avoid inevitable and irreparable evil
-  no more should be done than is reasonably necessary for the purpose to be achieved, and
-  the evil inflicted must not be disproportionate to the evil avoided.

**page 161**
##### **Activity 11.11**

**See Wilson, Section 10.6.D 'Necessity/duress of circumstances and murder' for a full discussion of the scope of justificatory necessity in cases of intentional killing. Looking more closely at** *Re A (Conjoined Twins)***. It could be suggested that central to the decision was the fact that the killing was a side effect of an otherwise entirely proper action rather than a means to an end. It would not justify, for example, killing a terminally ill patient to provide organs for others who would die without them. Looked at in this way, it is possible that the defence of necessity may well be applicable outside the medical arena to cases where the only way to prevent loss of life is to take action which, incidentally, causes others to die.** 

**What defence, if any, can be relied upon in the following examples?**

- **a. D is crossing a road. He sees in front of him that the central reservation is full of people waiting to cross to the other side. A lorry is bearing down on him. If he does not push into the people on the reservation he will be hit and possibly killed. He notices that there are also lorries on the other carriageway, equally dangerous to anyone who steps out from the central reservation. He knows that if he pushes his way on to the central reservation someone will be pushed off to their certain death or serious injury. He does so and V is killed as a result.**
- **b. D is caught on the staircase of a sinking ship, and the woman in front of him is frozen with fear and cannot move. D knows that if he does not move her he will be drowned and that he can only do so by throwing her down the staircase to her certain death by drowning. He does so and she drowns.**
- **c. A jet fighter from the Royal Air Force shoots down a passenger plane, which has been hijacked by terrorists, just as it is about to be flown into a 30-storey office block. All of the passengers and crew are killed.**
