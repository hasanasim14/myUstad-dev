# General defences 1 Introduction and Failure of Proof Defences Professor William Wilson

## How do defences fit in?

There are 3 elements in criminal liability

- 1. D must have done something wrong (*actus reus*)
- 2. He must be at fault (*mens rea)*
- 3. He must be unable to raise any defence in answer to the charge.

## General Defences

Defences --> Failure of Proof --> Automatism, Insanity, Intoxication, Mistake
       |---> Affirmative Defences --> Duress, Necessity, Self Defence


## Failure of Proof Defences

• Failure of Proof Defences are those defences which function to negate an one or more of the elements of the crime.

## Case Study
- A nurse puts a baby on a fire, witnessed by the baby's mother. The baby dies. Nurse is charged with murder.
- She denies *mens rea.* Will jury convict?

The position changes if she is permitted to adduce evidence that she was completely drunk (or insane).

## Importance of Failure of Proof Defences

• These defences are very important therefore because they enable a defendant to deflect a conviction where otherwise it would be inevitable.

## Intoxication

**Intoxication** – defendants who are voluntarily intoxicated can raise evidence of intoxication to negate their *mens rea* **BUT ONLY** for crimes which require proof of intention – eg murder, s.18, theft.

For all other crimes voluntary intoxication is treated as sufficient fault to convict the defendant. A drunken arsonist is a guilty arsonist since arson can be committed without proof of intention.

## Insanity

**Insanity –** A defendant can avoid responsibility for **any** crime if they were legally insane at the time of committing the crime. The burden of proving insanity is on the defendant for this defence.

## Automatism
**Automatism** – A defendant can avoid responsibility for any crime if they were in a state of automatism at the time of committing the crime. This is subject to one important qualification. Responsibility cannot be avoided if the defendant was at fault in being in this condition.

Automatism takes two forms:

**Form 1**: The first form is being unable to control one's bodily movements:

**Example:** A has a heart attack at the wheel of a car and so fails to stop as required at a traffic signal.

**Form 2**: The second form means being sSbject to a mental condition which prevents one from knowing what one was doing at the time of committing the offence

**Example:** D has a tooth removed by anaesthetic. On the way home he causes a traffic accident as a result of being groggy from the effects of the anaesthetic
