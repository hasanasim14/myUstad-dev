## WHAT IS CRIMINAL LAW Dr Laura Lammasniemi

## Introduction Video Transcript

Welcome to criminal law! I am Dr Laura Lammasniemi, the convenor of criminal law.

Before I say a few words about what criminal law is, I want to ask you a question. When I say the word 'criminal offence', what comes to your mind?

Perhaps you thought about murder or manslaughter. These are forms of unlawful killings that we see so much of in the news, sadly so. Perhaps you thought of violence, sexual violence, or even theft. These are all serious offences and these are offences that we will study together in this course. When we think about criminal law or read about criminal law in the news, it is often these serious crimes we think of. Yet, they are not the full extent of criminal law. Most criminal law is actually quite ordinary. Criminal law also consists of less serious regulatory offences. These regulatory offences regulate our daily lives in a way that we don't even often realise. These offences govern things like driving, parking, and safety at workplaces. They are important rules that ensure that society is run smoothly. These offences exist as a preventative measure, to prevent harm from happening in the future.

As important as these regulatory offences are, in this course, we will not really focus on them. We will focus more on those serious crimes such as murder, rape and causing grievous bodily harm. These serious offences are different from regulatory offences in many ways. One of the key differences is the reasons behind why they are criminalised. If you think of murder for example, we do not criminalise murder only to prevent harm from happening in the future. We criminalise murder to punish the offenders and to apportion blame for harm that has already happened.

Punishment is one of the key functions of criminal law. It is important to remember that it is not the only function of criminal law. Prevention of crime and maintaining social order are also very important functions of criminal law.

What then is criminal law? You might be wondering. In its very simplest or in its most basic form, we can define criminal law as a body of rules that set out the definitions of criminal offences and the rules and procedures that apply when the police investigate those offences. This is quite a boring definition though and it does not tell us much about the nature of criminal law or any of that thinking that underpins those rules that we will study.

Perhaps a better way to think about it is that at its very core, criminal law imposes restrictions on individual rights and on individual freedoms, through the threat or the imposition of penal sanctions. In other words criminal law tells us all what we can and cannot do. It tells us we cannot kill or steal, and if we break these rules we will be punished for it.

Although our focus on this course will be on substantive criminal law and it will be focusing on thinking about the elements of offences and defences, it's good to remember that none

of these offences or defences can be properly understood without due attention to the context in which they have been created in and they operate in. As you study different offences and defences you work through the topics on VLE, try to always ask yourself: Why and how is this particular conduct or activity criminalised?

Finally, I want to say a word about studying criminal law. All your key materials will be found on the Laws VLE, and you can use the textbook to supplement those studies. Some of the studies in criminal law might be little bit tough. There are some areas of criminal law that are complex or technical, and we will ask you to read many cases throughout the year. Too many cases, some students have said in the past. But do not be deterred. Studying criminal law is very rewarding too and you will learn a great deal about law, about punishment and even perhaps about human nature.

I hope you will enjoy the study of criminal law, and I wish you the best of luck with it.
