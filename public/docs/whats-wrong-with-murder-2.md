## Murder's Special Defences
### Loss of Control

A defendant who kills due to losing their self control may raise the defence of loss of control **IF** they are the subject of acts or words which fall under what the Act calls a 'qualifying trigger'.

Assuming this qualifying trigger is present the defence is available **IF** people of normal tolerance might have been expected to react in the same way.

#### Loss of Control: The elements

- 1. Loss of control
- 2. Caused by a Qualifying Trigger
- 3. People of normal tolerance might be expected to have reacted similarly

*Loss of Control: The elements (1 and 2)*

- 1. Loss of Control
- 2. The qualifying triggers

Section (55(1)) Coroners and Justice Act 2009

- A. fear of serious violence against D or another person, OR
- B. things said or done which
  - (i) are extremely grave, and
  - (ii) induced D to believe he had been seriously wronged, which belief was, in the circumstances, justifiable.

*Loss of Control: The Qualifying Triggers (A)*

Section (55(1)) Coroners and Justice Act 2009

A. fear of serious violence against D or another person,

*Loss of Control: The Qualifying Triggers (B)*

- B. things said or done which
  - (i) are extremely grave, and
  - (ii) induced D to believe he had been seriously wronged, which belief was, in the circumstances, justifiable.

*Loss of Control: The elements (3)*

• People of normal tolerance might be expected to have reacted similarly (CJA 2009 s.55(1)(C)

### Diminished responsibility

Homicide Act 1957 (as amended)

Section 2(1) A person ("D") who kills or is a party to the killing of another is not to be convicted of murder if D was suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning which—

(a) arose from a recognised medical condition,

(b) substantially impaired D's ability to do one or more of the things mentioned in subsection (1A), and

(c) provides an explanation for D's acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing.

(1A) Those things are—
- (a) to understand the nature of D's conduct;
- (b) to form a rational judgment;
- (c) to exercise self-control.

### Diminished responsibility: The elements

To be able to rely on this defence it must be proved that D suffered from an abnormality of mental functioning which

- 1. arose from a recognised medical condition
- 2. Which substantially impaired D's ability to think rationally/understand what he was doing/exercise self control
- 3. Which explains/partially explains why D killed the victim

*A Three-Part Test (1)*

- 1. A Recognized Medical Condition
  - Includes chronic alcoholism (Tandy, Wood), depression, *R v Gittens* 1984 bi polar *R v Inglis* [\(2010\) EWCA Crim 2269\)](http://www.mentalhealthlaw.co.uk/R_v_Inglis_(2010)_EWCA_Crim_2269),paranoid schizophrenia Sutcliffe, R v (1981), brain damage, paranoid personality disorder *Martin* [2002], psychopathy (Byrne 1961), post natal depression, *Reynolds* (1998)
  - Voluntary drunkenness is not a recognised medical condition. *R v Dowds* (2013)

*A Three-Part Test (2)*

- 2. Which substantially impaired D's defendant's
  - understanding of what she was doing,
  - and/or forming a rational judgment,
  - and/or exercising self control

*A Three Part Test (3)*

3. Which explains/partially explains why D killed the victim

### Diminished responsibility: Case study

*R v Blackman (2017)*

D, a soldier, while in action in Afghanistan, shot dead an unarmed prisoner who was a member of the Taliban. He was charged with murder. His defence was diminished responsibility. He claimed he was suffering from combat stress which induced in him a hatred of the Taliban and a desire for revenge.
