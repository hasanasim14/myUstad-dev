### Introduction

Criminal homicide comprises two key forms: murder and involuntary manslaughter. Both forms involve a similar *actus reus*, namely **an unlawful killing of a human being**. They are distinguished by their respective mental elements.

- u Murder requires the killing to be accompanied by an **intention** to kill, or an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. Manslaughter does not.
- u Manslaughter does require proof of fault but the nature of that fault varies according to the type of manslaughter charged.
  - u Reckless manslaughter requires **foresight** of death or serious injury.
  - u Gross negligence manslaughter requires no foresight, but a very high degree of **negligence** as to the risk of death.
  - u Constructive manslaughter requires neither foresight nor even negligence as to the risk of death (or serious injury). It requires simply the commission of a crime likely to cause harm with the relevant *mens rea* for that crime.

#### **Illustration 7.1**

- **a. D launches a savage attack on V with fists and feet. V dies in hospital of his injuries.**
- **b. D, wishing to scare V from the neighbourhood, pours petrol through V's letterbox and sets it alight. V dies in the resulting fire.**
- **c. D, angry with V, delivers a single punch to V's chin. V falls over and hits his head on the pavement. V dies of the injury due to a weakness in his skull.**
- **d. D, an anaesthetist, gives V who is undergoing an operation a massive overdose of anaesthetic having failed to notice a decimal point on the dosage recommended in her anaesthetist's handbook. V dies as a result.**
- **e. D, aged 20, points a gun at V, her 10-year-old brother, in the course of a game and pulls the trigger. D believes it to be the toy gun given to her brother for Christmas. In fact it is the gun of her mother, who is a police officer, and the gun is loaded. V dies of the wound.**

Each of the above illustrations involves a killing of a human being. The first four involve a criminal homicide since the killing is unlawful.

- a. is murder since D has the fault element for murder.
- b. is reckless manslaughter. Although lacking the intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, there is evidence of foresight of either of these results. It is also constructive manslaughter.
- c. is constructive manslaughter. Although D neither intended nor foresaw death or serious injury he did intend to cause injury to V which is sufficient *mens rea*.
- d. is gross negligence manslaughter, which, depending on the jury's view of the matter, is charged when D kills V not in the course of an attack but in the course of doing something so carelessly as to justify holding D to account for the death.
- e. also involves homicide but it is not a criminal homicide, since D lacks criminal fault and so the killing is not unlawful.

In this chapter we shall begin with an examination of the common elements in murder and involuntary manslaughter, namely that there should be an unlawful killing of a human being. We shall follow up by examining each individual offence in turn, beginning with murder. Murder has three partial defences which, if successfully raised, reduce murder to voluntary manslaughter. We shall look at two of them, namely loss of self-control and diminished responsibility. We shall then examine the three forms of involuntary manslaughter.

### **7.1 Common elements in criminal homicide**

The common elements in criminal homicide are the prime conduct elements, constituted by 'an unlawful killing of a human being'. These elements comprise a killing, an unlawful killing and a human victim.

#### **7.1.1 A killing**

A killing in this context follows the general template for all criminal offences. It requires an act or, in the case of murder and gross negligence manslaughter but not constructive manslaughter, an omission in breach of duty.

##### **Activity 7.1**

**Read Wilson, Section 13.3.A.2 'Unlawful killing' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. What are the three principal ingredients which make up a 'killing'?**
- **b. If V refuses consent to a life-saving operation must his surgeon still perform the operation if she is to avoid a conviction for criminal homicide?**

**page 72**
- **c. Under what circumstances will an omission to prevent someone from dying amount to a 'killing'? If you have forgotten, read Wilson, Section 4.5.D.3 'Circumstances giving rise to a duty to act: duty situations'.**
- **d. For the purpose of criminal homicide, when will D be considered to have caused V's death? If you have forgotten, read Wilson, Section 5.5 'Causation: the legal position'.**

#### **7.1.2 An unlawful killing**

A killing is lawful if it is accidental; that is, not blameworthy (see Illustration 7.1(e)). It is also lawful if a valid defence operates, for example self defence.

Consent is not a defence to liability for criminal homicide by affirmative action: there is no defence of euthanasia or of (consensual) duelling. A recent affirmation of this principle occurred in *Nicklinson* (2014). Mr Nicklinson suffered from 'lockedin-syndrome', following a stroke, which rendered every muscle in his body below his eyelids paralysed. He sought a declaration that it would be lawful on grounds of necessity for his doctors or his wife to terminate his life, since his condition rendered his life intolerable. He claimed that a refusal would be in violation of his human rights and his autonomy since, because of his total paralysis, he was being denied the rights of all other people to take the steps necessary to kill himself in such intolerable circumstances. His claim was rejected. The appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court. The decision was later affirmed in the European Court of Human Rights case *Nicklinson* v *UK (Admissibility)* (2478/15) (2015) 61 EHRR SE7 on the ground that the matter was so morally contentious that only Parliament could properly address it. It should be noted that no such caution characterised the court decision in an equivalent challenge made in Canada (*Carter* v *Canada (Attorney-General)* 6 February 2015). The prohibition on physician assisted suicide was declared contrary to human rights by the Supreme Court of Canada. In reaching this conclusion the Court ruled that the corresponding prohibition in the Canadian Criminal Code (241(b)) infringed s.7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

United Kingdom criminal law does respect a person's autonomy to a certain degree, however. If V refuses medical treatment which will save their life, or even the life of another, doctors who accede to that refusal are not responsible for the resulting death(s). Indeed the doctors will be acting unlawfully if they override V's decision and operate. So it was unlawful for a doctor to perform an emergency caesarean on a woman without her consent, although it was necessary to save the life of both the woman and her unborn child (*St George's Healthcare NHS Trust* v *S* [1999] Fam 26).

##### **Activity 7.2**

**If respect for autonomy explains the court's approach in the latter case, how can the decision in** *Nicklinson* **be justified?** 

**No feedback provided.**

#### **7.1.3 A human victim**

The law of criminal homicide protects only living humans. It is not criminal homicide to kill a foetus in the womb, although this may constitute the separate offence of abortion or child destruction. A criminal homicide also cannot be charged if the acts are directed against a person already dead. Therefore, two issues need considering: first, when does life begin, and second, when does life end?

##### **Activity 7.3**

**Read Wilson, Section 13.3.A.3 'In being' and then answer the following questions.**

- **a. What test do the courts apply in deciding whether the victim's life had begun at the time of the unlawful act in question?**
- **b. If D performs an abortion on herself which causes the child to be born alive but the child then dies because it is born prematurely, is a conviction for murder or manslaughter possible?**

**page 73**
- **c. Do you agree with their Lordships' conclusion in the** *A-G's Reference (No 3 of 1994)* **case that, as a matter of principle, the intention necessary to convict D of murder could not be transferred from the mother to the foetus and then back again to the living child? Why did the intention not transfer between the mother and the child as soon as the child was born?**
- **d. Would their Lordships' conclusion have been different if the prosecution had been able to prove that D had stabbed V for the purpose of killing the foetus rather than hurting V?**
- **e. What test do the courts apply in deciding whether the victim's life had already ended at the time of the unlawful act in question?**
- **f. Under what circumstances will it not result in a conviction for criminal homicide if D removes a patient from a life-support machine? You might find it helpful to reread Wilson, Section 4.5.D.1 'Acts and omissions: what's the difference?' on this question as well as the above reading.**

### **7.2 Murder**

We have examined the *actus reus* of murder, which is an unlawful killing of a human being. All that is left to discuss, of the basic elements, is the *mens rea*.

#### **7.2.1 Intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm**

Traditionally, the fault element in murder is described as malice aforethought. However, it is better to forget this form of words, which was coined in an earlier, less definition-driven age. Neither malice nor premeditation is required. A killing done intentionally in the heat of the moment is just as much murder as one which has been planned and premeditated. An intentional killing is murder if prompted by compassion as much as if it is prompted by greed. So, in *Inglis* [2011] 1 WLR 1110, the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction for murder of a mother whose son was suffering persistent vegetative state following a car accident and whom she had deliberately injected with heroin as an act of compassion.

The *mens rea* for murder is intention to kill (also known as express malice) or intention to cause grievous bodily harm (also known as implied malice). The mental state common to both these is intention.

#### **7.2.2 What does intention mean?**

We examined the meaning of intention in Chapter 5 of this module guide. It means, in the context of murder, having death (or grievous bodily harm) as one's objective in acting as one did such that, if death (or grievous bodily harm) did not occur, one would consider one's action a failure (Duff, 1990).

Occasionally, the judge will direct the jury that it is entitled to find intention in the absence of evidence of such 'direct' intention if, although it was not the actor's aim or objective to cause death (or grievous bodily harm), the jury considers that D knew either of these outcomes was virtually or morally certain. This is known as 'indirect' or oblique intention. As we have already covered in detail what intention means, in this chapter you will see how it is used in practice.

Much of the criminal law is about getting the right instruction for the jury. Many of the cases which you have encountered here and in Wilson, and will continue to encounter, are cases where the judge got this instruction wrong – if only slightly – which opened up the case to an appeal. I hope this makes you feel more comfortable about your own knowledge and understanding!

##### **7.2.3 Directing the jury on the** *mens rea* **for murder**

In the vast majority of cases the judge must give the jury the **standard** direction, which does not define intention except to say that intention is different from motive. So, on the facts in Illustration 7.2, only a standard direction should be given.

**page 74**
##### **Illustration 7.2**

**D, a gangster, stabs V through the abdomen in the course of a fight. V dies. D is charged with murder. D denies an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. He says it was an accident.**

#### **The standard direction will be something like this:**

Members of the jury, to find the defendant guilty of murder the question you must ask yourself is: 'Did D stab V with the intention of killing V?' If you are not sure that he did have this intention then ask yourselves: 'Did D stab V with the intention of causing V serious injury?' If your answer to either of these questions is yes then you must find the accused guilty of murder. If you are not sure that he had either of these intentions but are sure that he did intend some harm then you may find him guilty of manslaughter.

Now assume the following facts.

#### **Illustration 7.3**

**D, a gangster, throws V, a rival gangster, off the roof of a three-storey house and is charged with murder. D claims that it was not his intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to V: they were rivals and he did it to 'teach him a lesson and to make him fearful of challenging D's supremacy'.**

Here there is evidence that D may well have had something else in mind other than death or grievous bodily harm when he threw V off the roof. The jury will, therefore, need some guidance as to whether it is entitled to convict D of murder given the extreme likelihood that death or serious injury would result from such an act. Only where, as here, the evidence strongly supports the possibility that D acted for a purpose other than to kill (e.g. to frighten, to escape, to intimidate, to reduce pain suffered by the other) must the special direction be given. For example:

Members of the jury, you have been told that it was not D's intention in throwing V off the roof to kill him or cause him serious injury but simply to teach him a lesson. You are entitled to disbelieve this but if you think that this claim may be true I must direct you that you may still find the necessary intention if you are convinced that, whatever else D intended, he knew that one of these consequences would almost certainly occur. If you think that, then I must also direct you that you are **not** entitled to find the necessary intention, unless you feel sure that death or serious bodily harm was a virtual certainty, barring some unforeseen intervention, as a result of the defendant's actions and that the defendant appreciated that such was the case. In deciding whether the intention is present, however, you must make your decision on the basis of all the evidence.

(based on *Woollin* [1999] AC 82, per Lord Steyn at 87)

Most juries would convict of murder on the basis of such a direction as they would no doubt consider broken bones (grievous bodily harm) **at the very least** to be a virtual certainty and be prepared to impute that knowledge to the defendant on the basis that if they know it then he knew it.

There are two important things to be noted about this direction. The first is that the direction does not instruct the jury that it is bound to find intention where there is foresight of certainty, only that it is entitled to. The second is that the direction tells the jury that it may not find the necessary intention unless the defendant foresaw the death or grievous bodily harm as virtually certain. Foresight of high probability is not enough. This would be sufficient only for manslaughter.

Now consider this example.

##### **Illustration 7.4**

**D is caught in a blazing fire in the third-storey bedroom of her home with V, her three-year-old son. D panics, believing that they are both doomed unless they jump out the window. She pushes her son out of the window and then jumps herself. V dies in the fall; D survives.**

Again there is evidence that D had something else in mind other than causing death or grievous bodily harm when she threw V out of the window. Again, therefore, the jury

**page 75**
will need some guidance as to whether it is entitled to convict D of murder given the extreme likelihood that death or serious injury would result from such an act. Again the *Woollin* direction must therefore be given:

*Members of the jury, you have been told that it was not D's intention in throwing V out of the window to kill him or cause him serious injury. Far from it, it was to save him. If you think that this claim may be true I must tell you that you may still find the necessary intention if you are convinced that, whatever else D intended, she knew that one of these consequences would occur. If you think that, then I must direct you that you are **not** entitled to find the necessary intention, unless you feel sure that death or serious bodily harm was a virtual certainty (barring some unforeseen intervention) as a result of the defendant's actions and that the defendant appreciated that such was the case. In deciding whether the intention is present, however, you must make your decision on the basis of all the evidence which requires you of course to consider the context within which D threw her son out of the window.*

A jury would probably not wish to convict of murder on the basis of such a direction although it would no doubt still consider broken bones (grievous bodily harm) **at the very least** to be a virtual certainty and be prepared to impute that knowledge to the defendant on the basis that if they know it then she knew it.

The jury would be entitled not to convict because of two aspects of the direction. The first, dealt with above, is that the direction does not instruct the jury that it is **bound to** find intention where there is foresight of certainty, only that it is **entitled to**. The second is that the direction tells the jury to reach its decision on the basis of all the evidence. Taking into account D's motive, this form of words sends a pretty clear message to the jury that 'foresight of certainty' is not conclusive. With this message, the jury's natural humanity can be relied upon to reach the common-sense verdict of not guilty.

Note that if D is not guilty of murder, the jury should not bring in a verdict of manslaughter either, since, in effect, they are concluding that the killing was not done recklessly (justified-risk taking), was not unlawful (no intention to harm/ no recklessness) and was not grossly negligent (reasonable conduct in the circumstances).

Of course there are other means of avoiding a conviction for murder here, namely the possibility of raising a defence of necessity, but the courts have set their face against developing a general defence of necessity to cover such cases preferring to rely on the jury's good sense via the *mens rea* requirement.

**Note:** If D kills using a lethal weapon, poison or extreme violence, the standard direction will almost invariably be the correct one and *Woollin* should not be used.

#### **7.2.4 What has to be intended?**

It is important to remember that the *mens rea* for murder is **either** an intention to kill the victim **or** an intention to cause grievous bodily harm to the victim. This was made clear in *Vickers* [1957] 2 QB 664 and confirmed in *Cunningham* [1982] AC 566, in which the defendant repeatedly hit the victim over the head with a chair which caused his death. The defendant appealed against his conviction for murder, arguing that *Vickers* was wrongly decided and an intention to kill was necessary. This was rejected and *Vickers* affirmed.

##### **Activity 7.4**

**Read Wilson, Section 13.4.A.2 'The law post-1957' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. How have the courts defined 'grievous bodily harm'?**
- **b. Is it a helpful definition?**
- **c. Who decides whether the harm intended by D is properly described as 'grievous'?**
- **d. Does 'grievous bodily harm' require the harm intended to be potentially life threatening?**

**page 76**
#### **7.2.5 Directing the jury: intentional violence**

So how should the jury be directed in a case where, although D causes V's death by an act of intentional violence, the injury intended was not life threatening?

Consider the following example.

##### **Illustration 7.5**

**D, a member of a criminal gang, decides to teach V, a member of a rival gang, a lesson. D takes an iron bar, smashes both V's kneecaps with it and leaves him in the street. V crawls along the pavement and tumbles on to the road where he is killed by a passing car.** 

In this case the prosecution has all it needs to gain a conviction for murder. It can prove both *actus reus* and causation. It also has strong evidence of a direct intention to cause V grievous bodily harm. It has no need to prove anything else. The trial judge will direct the jury as follows.

Members of the jury, to find the defendant guilty of murder the question you must ask yourself is: 'Did D act with the intention of killing V?' If you are not sure that he did, then ask yourselves: 'Did D act with the intention of causing V serious injury?' If he did, this is sufficient to convict. It is not necessary for the prosecution to prove to you that the injury D intended was life threatening. What it has to prove is that the injury is really serious. It is up to you to decide whether smashing both kneecaps is really serious injury for this purpose but I hardly need to advise you that the consequences of such an injury, although not life threatening, are likely to be long lasting and severe.

#### **7.2.6 Reforming murder**

There is general dissatisfaction with the law relating to murder. The major problem from which all others derive is the mandatory life sentence. This means that a coldblooded serial killer receives the same sentence as a caring spouse who performs euthanasia on a terminally ill partner, and the same sentence as someone (as in Illustration 7.5) who, intending only to cause serious injury, causes that person's death when others would have survived. Many commentators believe that the intention to cause serious injury should not be sufficient for murder since it is a form of constructive liability; that is, liability for the greater crime (murder) is constructed out of the elements of a lesser crime (causing grievous bodily harm with intent). This is a breach of the correspondence principle (see Chapter 6 of this module guide) and, given the mandatory life sentence for murder, it is a gross breach. See, for example, Lord Steyn's speech in *Powell and Daniels* [1999] 1 AC 1.

##### **Activity 7.5**

**The Law Commission has recommended that murder should be divided into two degrees of gravity (Law Com 304:** *Murder, manslaughter and infanticide* **(2006)). You will find discussion of this and other reform proposals in Wilson, Section 13.4.B 'Conclusions: a rational** *mens rea* **for murder', which you should now read. What reforms are advocated here? Do you agree that murder should include certain forms of reckless killing?**

**No feedback provided.**

### **7.3 Voluntary manslaughter**

Apart from the general defences, murder is served by three special (partial) defences which, if successful, reduce a murder conviction to a conviction for voluntary manslaughter. It is called voluntary manslaughter because the prosecution can prove the killing was voluntary (in the sense of being intended or almost intended), but the context provides a degree of mitigation which would render the mandatory sentence unjust. We shall be covering here two of these partial defences, namely **loss of control** (known as provocation until 2010) and **diminished responsibility**.

**page 77**
#### **7.3.1 Provocation**

Provocation still applies in relation to killings preceding 2009 and so will be dealt with very briefly here. It is similar in structure to the defence which replaces it, namely, loss of control. Moreover, many of the principles underlying the defence are similar to those underlying the new defence so it is useful to read this section carefully.

Provocation had a subjective and an objective element. The subjective element was that the killing should result from a loss of self-control which was triggered by provocative deeds or actions. Loss of self-control which has not been triggered by another's deeds or actions is not covered by the defence (*Acott* [1996] 4 All ER 443). The requirement of loss of self-control excluded revenge, and other premeditated killings, from the coverage of the defence (*Ibrams* (1982) 74 Cr App R 154). It was long thought to mean that the defence could not be relied upon if there was a time lapse between the last piece of provocation and the killing (*Duffy* [1949] 1 All ER 932). In *Ahluwalia* [1992] 4 All ER 889 it was said that although provocation required a loss of self-control it did not necessarily follow that it should be by way of **immediate** reaction. In particular, a woman subject to cumulative domestic abuse might lose her self-control after a period of 'slow burn', simmering anger which erupts long after the last provocative event. So long as the killing was by way of loss of self-control, and not revenge or premeditation, the defence remained available.

The objective element was that the defendant's conduct should be consistent with that of reasonable people faced with a similar trigger. In deciding this question the jury was to take into account any characteristics of the defendant which **made the acts or words of the provoker provocative**, for example their race, size, weight, colour, hair colour, habits or sexuality, if this was the target of the provocation. The jury was **not** to take into account any characteristic which may have reduced the defendant's **self-control** below that of reasonable people (e.g. their intoxication, mental illness, excitable or aggressive temperament).

#### **7.3.2 Loss of control**

The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 retains the overall structure of provocation, but restricts its application considerably by limiting the kind of triggers upon which the defendant can rely to ground their loss of self-control. Under the previous law, defendants had successfully used the defence in many cases thought to be undeserving, for example loss of self-control triggered by a crying infant, a nagging partner or, most commonly, an unfaithful partner. This is no longer possible. The new defence requires the defendant's conduct to be partially justified by the context. It is not enough, in other words, that they, perhaps excusably, simply 'lost it'.

Section 54 of the act states the guiding principles of the new defence:

- (1) Where a person ('D') kills or is a party to the killing of another (V) D is not to be convicted of murder if –
  - (a) D's acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing resulted from D's loss of self-control, the loss of self-control
  - (b) the loss of self-control had a qualifying trigger, and
  - (c) a person of D's sex and age, **with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint and in the circumstances of D, might have** reacted in the same or in a similar way to D.
- (2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), it does not matter whether or not the loss of control was sudden [our emphasis].

#### **7.3.3 The subjective element**

Like provocation, the defence contains a subjective hurdle requiring a loss of (self-) control, which is caused by what is termed a qualifying trigger.

**page 78**
#### **7.3.4 Loss of control**

The concept of loss of control is not straightforward. What is it to lose self-control? In *Duffy* [1949] 1 All ER 932, decided under the old law, Devlin J gave the classic definition as involving the accused being 'so subject to passion as to make him or her for the moment not master of his or her mind'. In other words, loss of self-control is not simply a loss of temper. It requires the defendant, literally to be rendered unable to control themselves. The fact that the killing appears frenzied or disproportionate is not in itself sufficient evidence of this (*R* v *Goodwin* [2018] EWCA 2287). It follows from the requirement that the defendant killed while out of control that a revenge killing cannot ground the defence. This is in fact made explicit in s.54(4), which states that the defence is not available if, in doing or being a party to the killing, the defendant acted in a considered desire for revenge. But, consolidating *Ahluwalia*, the loss of self-control does not have to be sudden. As *Ahluwalia* made clear, it is quite possible for a loss of control to be experienced in cases such as cumulative domestic abuse even after a significant delay between the abuser's last act and the victim's reaction. However, the judge should always direct the jury that, as a matter of pure evidence, the longer the time lag between the trigger and the killing, the less likely it is that the killing is attributable to D's loss of self-control. In *R* v *Dawes and Hatter* [2013] EWCA Crim 322, the defence was held not available where the killings, although clearly influenced by the consequences of the break-up of relationships, were premeditated and considered rather than spontaneous.

#### **7.3.5 The qualifying triggers**

As has been explained, to rely on loss of control, the trigger must be sufficiently serious to justify the loss. There are two such 'qualifying' triggers.

Section 55(4) Where D's loss of self-control was attributable to a thing or things done or said (or both) which—

(a) constituted circumstances of an extremely grave character, and

(b) caused D to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged.

#### **7.3.6 First qualifying trigger**

The first qualifying trigger is fear of serious violence. Specifically, it operates where D's loss of self-control was attributable to D's fear of serious violence from V against D or another identified person (s.55 (3)).

A typical scenario covered by this trigger is the person who, after a period of cumulative violence, snaps and kills their tormentor (see *Ahluwalia*, above). Read together with s.54(1) and (4), the fear must trigger a loss of self-control rather than, say, a desire to be avenged or a rational decision to put an end to an ongoing source of torment. This qualifying trigger would also cover cases such as *Clegg* [1995] 1 AC 482 and *Martin (Anthony)* [2001] EWCA Crim 2245 (see Chapter 11) where the respective defendants killed wrongdoers in circumstances where there was reason for fear but no good reason for what transpired to be an (over)reaction to that fear. In both cases, the defendant's claim would be something to the effect that, 'In the heat and stress of the moment I was so fearful of the prospect of myself (or my colleagues) being killed or seriously hurt that I just lost my ability to control myself'.

As may be appreciated, the kind of scenario in which this trigger operates is the same kind of scenario that might also generate a plea of self-defence. In practice, because a successful raising of self-defence is a total defence, a person who kills in the context of violence used or threatened against them or another is likely to prefer raising this defence, either in addition to or in substitution for loss of control. If they fail with self-defence, the court may allow the evidence raised in support of this defence, if it is sufficiently compelling, to be considered by the jury in relation to the alternative defence of loss of control (*R* v *Goodwin* [2018] EWCA 2287).

**page 79**
##### **Illustration 7.6**

**W comes across H viciously beating C, their infant child. W loses control and stabs H through the heart with a kitchen knife, killing him.**

There are two defences W can run here. The first is self-defence, which is available (like loss of control) where **another person** is subject to the attack or threatened attack. The second is loss of control. By raising the evidence needed to run self-defence, W may avail herself of loss of control if, for example, the jury reject the former defence on the ground that the force used was disproportionate.

#### **7.3.7 Second qualifying trigger**

The second qualifying trigger operates

Where D's loss of self-control was attributable to a thing or things done or said (or both) which—

- (a) constituted circumstances of an extremely grave character, and
- (b) caused D to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged (s.55(4).

This is the more usual trigger relied upon to raise loss of control, reflective of the kind of triggering event relied upon under the previous law of provocation. It poses two questions.

- 1. Is the loss of self-control attributable to things said or done which constitute circumstances of **an extremely grave character**?
- 2. Did these extremely grave circumstances cause D to have a **justifiable** sense of being **seriously wronged**?

The first question is designed to filter out trivial triggers such as 'nagging', crying babies and sexual jealousy because they do not constitute circumstances of an 'extremely grave character'. Sexual infidelity is in fact explicitly excluded from the range of qualifying triggers by s.55(6) (see below).

There are two components to the second question. The trigger must cause D to feel seriously wronged. If D would have killed anyway, the trigger is inoperative (see also discussion of s.55(6) below). Also, D must be **justified** in feeling that they have been seriously wronged. It will normally follow from being the subject of an extremely grave provocation that a person's sense of being seriously wronged is justifiable.

But not always. In *Bowyer* [2013] EWCA Crim 322 D, who was known to V, was discovered burgling V's flat. V, in his anger, made some extremely insulting comments about D's girlfriend whereupon D lost his self-control and killed V. The Court of Appeal confirmed that the defence was not available since D's status as a burglar blew apart his claim that he was **justified** in thinking he was being seriously wronged.

##### **Activity 7.6**

**Read Wilson, Section 13.5.A.2 'The elements of the defence', Section (a) 'The subjective element' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. A calls B a paedophile. B loses self-control and kills A. Assuming this insult constitutes circumstances of 'an extremely grave character', under what circumstances, if any, would B's sense of being seriously wronged not be justifiable?**
- **b. V imprisons X in order to prevent X from executing his plan to harm Y. X kills V in indignant reaction to the loss of freedom. Is the defence of loss of self-control available to X?**

#### **7.3.8 Other restrictions on the use of the qualifying triggers**

Section 55(6) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 states:

**page 80**
In determining whether a loss of self-control had a qualifying trigger –

(a) D's fear of serious violence is to be disregarded to the extent that it was caused by a thing which D incited to be done or said for the purpose of providing an excuse to use violence;

(b) a sense of being seriously wronged by a thing done or said is not justifiable if D incited the thing to be done or said for the purpose of providing an excuse to use violence...

#### **7.3.9 Explanation**

If D is at fault in causing V to use violence, for example D strikes the first blow, or says or does something provocative (e.g. commits a sexual assault on V) which triggers a violent or otherwise abusive reaction from V, D is not disabled from using V's conduct as a qualifying trigger (*Johnson* [1989] 1 WLR 740). However, if D does so **in order to give themself an excuse** to kill V when V retaliates, then D is disabled. This was confirmed in *Bowyer* [2013] EWCA Crim 322.

#### **7.3.10 Sexual infidelity**

Under the old law of provocation, one of the most common triggers, in line with the defence's heavily gendered nature, was sexual jealousy and possessiveness. The new law seeks to remove gender bias from the defence by ensuring that emotions such as sexual jealousy and unjustified anger are no longer qualifying triggers. Only justified loss of self-control is covered.

To make sure no judge was under any illusions that sexual jealousy was a qualifying trigger, s.55(6) explicitly excludes it. Now a person who kills because they witness or hear about the sexual infidelity of their partner cannot use the defence. In *Clinton, Parker & Evans* [2012] EWCA Crim 2, an important clarification was made by the Court of Appeal. In effect *Clinton* interprets s.55(6) to mean that sexual infidelity which prompts a loss of self-control due to sexual jealousy, possessiveness or family honour is not a qualifying trigger. However, if the sexual infidelity provides the context within which another trigger operates it must be considered.

In *Clinton*, D killed his wife having found out she was unfaithful. However, the loss of self-control was not prompted by possessiveness or jealousy but by the fact that, when asked to reconsider her wish to leave D, she abused him and made several extremely wounding remarks – including that she had had enough of looking after their children – and derided him for being too weak-minded to execute his desire to commit suicide. Thus, taking the whole context into account including the infidelity, D was able to claim that he was subject to things said or done which constituted circumstances of an extremely grave character and caused him to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged.

Since *Clinton*, other cases have occurred in which defendants have killed following a discovery of sexual infidelity. These have not been presented as cases where the killing was triggered by jealousy, but, as in *Clinton*, have been presented as cases where infidelity was one of a number of events which cumulatively constituted circumstances of an extremely grave character. In *Dawes and Hatter* [2013] EWCA Crim 322, the Court of Appeal, while approving the decision in *Clinton*, agreed with the trial judge that the fact of the break-up of a relationship, of itself, will not normally constitute circumstances of an extremely grave character and entitle the aggrieved party to feel a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged. As a result their convictions were upheld. The following statement of the trial judge in *Hatter* explains the decision:

To suggest that the fact of a break-up of a relationship could amount to circumstances of an extremely grave character or that it would entitle the aggrieved party to feel a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged would be to ignore the normal meaning of these words. It would also result in the defence of loss of control being left to the jury in almost every case where one partner to a relationship kills the other, which was clearly not Parliament's intention.

**page 81**
There must, in other words, be something , as happened in *Clinton*, **in addition** to the usual heartache and grievances accompanying the break-up of a relationship which renders the circumstances sufficiently grave to warrant a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged.

##### **Activity 7.7**

**Eve discovers her husband, Adam, having sex with Ruth, her daughter and his stepdaughter. Eve loses self-control and kills Adam. Is the defence of loss of self-control excluded under s.55(6)?**

#### **7.3.11The objective element**

In keeping with the old law of provocation, the new partial defence also contains an objective element. By s.54(1)(c), the reaction of the defendant must be consistent **with what might be expected of ordinary people of D's sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint and in the circumstances of D**. In *R* v *Willcocks* [2016] EWCA Crim 2043 the question for the court on appeal was whether a personality or mental disorder of the defendant was one of the circumstances the jury should take into account in deciding whether the defendant's reaction was to be expected. The Court of Appeal said that the trial judge was right to refuse to allow this to be taken into account, since the only relevance of this disorder was that it reduced the defendant's powers of self-restraint. The circumstances that the jury are able to take into account are circumstances to which any ordinary person may be subject (e.g. their race, religion, gender, sexual preference, physical appearance, past events and experience).

Another way of saying this is that it disqualifies the defendant from relying on the defence if his reaction was triggered not by an external element but by a character flaw, such as being unusually intolerant or aggressive, or being intoxicated (*Asmelash* [2013] EWCA Crim 157) and so less able to control themselves. People are expected to keep to the same standards of self-control as other ordinary people. If the individual has some condition or characteristic that reduces their ability to exercise self-control, they would be better advised to rely on the defence of diminished responsibility. The only internal matters that might impact on this objective standard are age, presumably because the young are more likely to be hot-headed, and sex, for less obvious reasons.

#### **7.3.12 Evidence and procedure**

The relative functions of judge and jury are described in s.54(5) and (6) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.

- (5) On a charge of murder, if sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue with respect to the defence under subsection (1), the jury must assume that the defence is satisfied unless the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt that it is not.
- (6) For the purposes of subsection (5), sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue with respect to the defence if evidence is adduced on which, in the opinion of the trial judge, a jury, properly directed, could reasonably conclude that the defence might apply.

As is usual in relation to defences, the burden of (dis)proof is on the prosecution. As is also usual, this burden of proof does not kick in unless D adduces evidence capable of leading the jury to conclude that the defence applies (s.54(5)). The judge decides whether the evidence so adduced by the defendant is so capable (s.54(6)). The judge would, therefore, disallow any evidence that the defendant lost their self-control due to intoxication, sexual jealousy, their partner's nagging, their baby crying and so on. If, however, the defendant's evidence was, for example, that their partner had threatened them or the child with injury, or had been taking family money to support a lover or a business venture, or had been accused of some disgraceful act – i.e. anything capable of being viewed as extremely serious, the judge should permit the jury to consider this evidence to determine whether the defence should succeed. In each case, the judge must review the evidence before deciding whether it is strong

**page 82**
enough to put before the jury. As the Court of Appeal said in *R* v *Dawes*; *R* v *Hatter*; *R* v *Bowyer*, this is not a matter of judicial discretion but rather a matter of judgment that is either right or wrong. Nevertheless, as was explained in this case and reaffirmed in *Martin* [2017] EWCA Crim 1359, the Court of Appeal will be slow to interfere with the trial judge's judgment on this matter as he/she has heard the evidence first hand.

#### **7.3.13 Diminished responsibility**

Diminished responsibility originated in s.2 of the Homicide Act 1957. As with provocation, its purpose was to provide a sentencing discretion in cases of murder where serious mitigation exists. This was particularly important since, at the time, murder was a capital offence.

The defence was reconfigured by s.52 of the [Coroners and Justice Act 2009. The major](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/52)  [changes made were to clarify the type of mental abnormality which may ground the](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/52)  [defence, and the mechanism for substantiating that abnormality. Beyond this, the](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/52)  [defence covers much the same ground and pre-2009 cases are likely to remain of](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/52)  [authority where consistent with the new provisions. It should be noted that unusually](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/52)  [– and contrary to the position with loss of self-control – the burden of proof is on](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/52)  [the defence. The standard of proof is on the civil standards; that is, on the balance of](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/52)  [probabilities.](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/52)

Section 52 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 amends s.2(1) of the Homicide Act 1957 as follows.

- (1) A person ('D') who kills or is a party to the killing of another is not to be convicted of murder if D was suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning which –
  - (a) arose from a recognised medical condition,
  - (b) substantially impaired D's ability to do one or more of the things mentioned in subsection (1A), and
  - (c) provides an explanation for D's acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing.
- (1A) Those things are
  - (a) to understand the nature of D's conduct;
  - (b) to form a rational judgment;
  - (c) to exercise self-control.

In Sections 7.3.14–17, we look at the elements of diminished responsibility.

#### **7.3.14 Abnormality of mental functioning arising from a recognised mental condition**

First, it must be established that the defendant suffered an abnormality of mental functioning. An **abnormality of mental functioning** is not defined, but is traditionally regarded as an objectively significant deviation from what would be regarded as normal by a reasonable person. Obviously this is a rather vague test but is given focus by s.52(1A) which refers to its effect on D's ability:

- (a) to understand the nature of D's conduct;
- (b) to form a rational judgment;
- (c) to exercise self-control.

So a person who kills because their abnormality of mental functioning causes them to misinterpret V's words or actions, or causes them to interpret an innocent act as an aggressive act, or causes them to see dangers where there are none, or overestimate the danger they are facing, or because they killed at the prompting of 'internal voices', or simply because their abnormality reduced their powers of self-control, comes within the defence, so long as this results from a recognised mental condition.

**page 83**
#### **7.3.15 Recognised mental condition**

Under the old law, there was no requirement that the defendant's mental abnormality resulted from a recognised medical condition so long as it was caused by some 'inherent' condition. This created a degree of flexibility, which is either a good thing or a bad thing depending upon your point of view. Some of this flexibility has been removed. It is no longer possible, for example, for D to rely on the defence simply because they suffered chronic jealousy, or their powers of resistance had been worn down by the illness of a partner or child.

Recognised medical conditions can be found in authoritative classificatory lists, including the World Health Organization's *International Classification of Diseases* and the American Psychiatric Association's *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders*. It is likely that the following conditions, which grounded the old law, will continue to be accepted as recognised mental conditions.

- Arrested or retarded mental development.
- Depression (*Gittens* [1984] QB 698).
- Bipolar (*Inglis* [\[2010\] EWCA Crim](http://www.mentalhealthlaw.co.uk/R_v_Inglis_%282010%29_EWCA_Crim_2269) 2637).
- Paranoid schizophrenia (*Sutcliffe*, The Times, 30 April 1981).
- Brain damage.
- Psychopathy (*Byrne* [1960] 2 QB 396).
- Paranoid personality disorder (*Martin* (*Anthony*) [2001] EWCA Crim 2245).
- Postnatal depression (*Reynolds* [1988] Crim LR 679).

The new law, therefore, will require the testimony of expert witnesses in any case where the condition relied upon by the defendant is contested or ambiguous. The case of *Brennan* [2014] EWCA Crim 2387, clarifies an important procedural issue in relation to the defence. If medical evidence supporting a defence of diminished responsibility is put before the court by a medical expert and the prosecution do not contradict that evidence with evidence of their own medical expert, a charge of murder should be withdrawn from the jury. So if the prosecution do not like the expert evidence put before the court by the defence, they should appoint their own medical expert to rebut it. Examples of contested conditions which were accepted as a basis for the defence under the old law include battered women's syndrome (*Ahluwalia*; *Hobson* [1998] 1 Cr App R 31) and premenstrual syndrome (*Smith (Sandie)* [1982] Crim LR 531). Nevertheless, the decision is ultimately one for the judge. In *Osborne* [\[2010\] EWCA](http://www.mentalhealthlaw.co.uk/R_v_Osborne_%282010%29_EWCA_Crim_547)  [Crim 547](http://www.mentalhealthlaw.co.uk/R_v_Osborne_%282010%29_EWCA_Crim_547), the Court of Appeal ruled that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) would not afford any ground for allowing the appeal against conviction on the basis of diminished responsibility*.*

##### **Activity 7.8**

**Read Wilson, Sections 13.6.B 'Statutory definition' and 13.6.D 'Overlap with loss of self-control' and answer the following question.**

**Do the defences of loss of self-control and diminished responsibility adequately address the problem of battered partners who kill their abuser such as** *Ahluwalia***?**

#### **7.3.16 Alcohol and drugs**

The old law distinguished between binge drinking and chronic alcoholism. This separation is likely to be continued. Intoxication is not a 'medical condition' (*Fenton* (1975) 61 Cr App R 261; it will not therefore ground the new defence. In *[Dowds](http://www.mentalhealthlaw.co.uk/R_v_Dowds_%282012%29_EWCA_Crim_281,_%282012%29_MHLO_18)* [2012] [EWCA Crim 281, \(2012\) MHLO 18](http://www.mentalhealthlaw.co.uk/R_v_Dowds_%282012%29_EWCA_Crim_281,_%282012%29_MHLO_18), the Court of Appeal concluded that voluntary acute intoxication, whether from alcohol or another substance, is not capable of founding diminished responsibility. However, the abnormality of mental functioning does not have to be the sole cause of the killing so long as it 'provides an explanation' for D's participation in the killing. So a person who kills due to the combined effect of intoxication and a recognised mental condition may still have a defence (*Dietschmann*

**page 84**
[2003] 1 All ER 897, disapproving *Egan* [1992] 4 All ER 470). In *R* v *Kay* [2017] EWCA Crim 647, the fact that the defendant, who suffered with schizophrenia, was unable to provide evidence that it was his schizophrenia that provided the trigger for the killing rather than the fact that he was acutely intoxicated at the time meant he was unable to rely on the defence. In other words, just because a person is schizophrenic does not mean that they can rely on the defence unless they can establish that the schizophrenia, rather than another trigger such as intoxication, was the cause of the psychotic episode.

One exception to this rule arises where the defendant is a chronic alcoholic. Under the old law, chronic alcoholism could ground the defence as it was inherent to the defendant (*Wood* [2009] 1 WLR 496; *Stewart* [2009] 1 WLR 2507). This is still the law, since chronic alcoholism is a recognised medical condition and its effect, which is well known, is to provoke irresistible cravings for alcohol and consequently a reduced capacity for self-control and forming rational judgements. So Mr Kay could have relied upon the defence if he had been able to establish that the psychotic episode arose from a combination of schizophrenia and chronic alcoholism. Unfortunately for him, he could not. He was just drunk.

*Wood* is a typical case of this nature, involving a homeless alcoholic who, heavily intoxicated, killed an associate who had made a homosexual advance. The trial judge gave the misleading impression to the jury that the defendant's consumption of alcohol had to be entirely **involuntary** to count as an internal pathology capable of grounding the defence. The defendant's appeal was allowed for misdirection. The President of the Queen's Bench rejected the trial judge's proposition to the effect that 'unless every drink consumed that day by the appellant was involuntary, his alcohol dependency syndrome was to be disregarded'.

#### **7.3.17 Which provides an explanation for the killing**

The new provision requires that the abnormality must provide an **explanation** for the defendant's acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing. It must form part of the story as to why this killing took place: the defendant's reason was impaired, they did not fully understand what they were doing, or their self-control was lacking, and that is why – or one of the reasons why – they did what they did. A psychopath is, therefore, unlikely to be able to use this defence, since they lack neither ordinary powers of self-control nor normal cognitive abilities.

Section 52(1B) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 states that an explanation will be provided if 'it causes, or is a significant contributory factor in causing, D to carry out that conduct'. Whether it does provide an explanation for the killing is a question for the jury which, in cases involving multiple causes – for example depression and intoxication (see *Gittens*) or chronic alcoholism and intoxication (see *Wood*) – could prove a bit of a challenge.

#### **7.3.18 Substantially impaired**

The defence only operates if the mental abnormality substantially impaired D's ability to do one of the three things mentioned in s.52(1)(a). What does 'substantially' mean in this context? Does it mean a 'more than trivial impairment' (i.e. having substance) or does it mean weighty and important?

In *Golds* [2014] EWCA Crim 2760 the Court of Appeal preferred the second interpretation, ruling that the defendant's mental abnormality must have had a very significant effect on his ability to understand/control himself, etc. Whether the impairment crossed this threshold is a matter for the jury.

On appeal, the Supreme Court approved this ruling and dismissed Gold's appeal, stating that, for the purpose of diminished responsibility, 'substantially impaired' means 'something whilst short of total impairment is nevertheless significant and appreciable'.

### **7.4 Involuntary manslaughter**

Involuntary manslaughter can be one of three types:

- 'foresight' or 'reckless' manslaughter
- 'unlawful act' or 'constructive' manslaughter
- gross negligence manslaughter (causing death through lack of care).

One of your key tasks is to be clear about their respective areas of coverage. The three forms overlap to a certain extent but also have their own specific application.

#### **7.4.1 Overlap between forms of involuntary manslaughter**

Hyam (*Hyam* [1975] AC 55) and Smith (*Smith* [1961] AC 290) both killed in the course of doing something extremely dangerous. In the former case, Hyam threw a petrol bomb through V's letter box, while in the latter case, Smith drove his car extremely dangerously in an attempt to dislodge a police officer trying to arrest him. Both victims were killed. If these cases came to the courts today the defendants should not be charged with murder, which requires intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. They could, however, be charged with:

-  reckless manslaughter, if the prosecution could prove foresight of death or serious injury
-  gross negligence manslaughter, if, irrespective of whether the prosecution could prove foresight of death or serious injury, the jury considered their actions to be grossly negligent as to the risk of death
-  constructive manslaughter, since both defendants killed in the course of doing something illegal and dangerous.

**page 86**
The prosecution will tend to charge the form which is most easy to establish as a matter of evidence. Here this is probably constructive manslaughter, but the prosecution would still find it relatively easy to gain a conviction charging either of the other two forms.

#### **7.4.2 Distinctiveness**

There are, however, killings where only one form should be charged. This distinctiveness should be understood. Reckless manslaughter is rarely charged. Since acting with foresight of death or serious injury will usually be a criminal offence, almost all cases of reckless manslaughter will also be cases of constructive (unlawful act) manslaughter. Reckless manslaughter comes into its own when the defendant is charged with murder and the judge directs the jury that it can find the defendant guilty of manslaughter if not convinced there was the necessary intention but if convinced that the defendant foresaw death or serious injury as probable. Examples of cases where this would be appropriate include *Hyam* (1975), *Goodfellow* (1986) 83 Cr App R 23 and *Hancock and Shankland* [1985] 3 WLR 1014. Since this explanation tells us all we need to know about reckless manslaughter, no more will be said about it in this chapter.

Constructive manslaughter is the correct charge when there is evidence that death resulted from an unlawful and objectively dangerous act of D, but there is insufficient evidence that D intended (or foresaw) death or serious injury, or was grossly negligent as to the risk of death.

##### **Illustration 7.7**

**A hits B with a single punch to the jaw. B dies as a result of a hidden weakness in his skull which implodes under the force.**

This is constructive manslaughter; neither of the other two forms apply since A neither foresaw death nor grievous bodily harm, and nor was he grossly negligent as to the risk of death.

Gross negligence manslaughter is the correct charge where there is insufficient evidence that D foresaw death or serious injury resulting from their conduct and there is no unlawful and dangerous act upon which to graft liability. It is most appropriate, therefore, for those who kill in the course of performing a **lawful activity** in a criminally careless fashion, or who omit to do something they should have done. It covers, for example, parents who neglect their children, train drivers who ignore signals, electricians who forget to earth their circuits, builders who break building regulations, surgeons who perform incompetent surgery on their patients, bus drivers who fall asleep at the wheel and so on.

#### **7.4.3 Constructive manslaughter**

Constructive manslaughter is also known as unlawful act manslaughter. It is called constructive manslaughter because liability does not derive, as it usually must, from a combination of an *actus reu*s and *mens rea* which match a consequence with an equivalent mental state. Rather, liability for one crime is **constructed** out of the elements of another. For example, one can be guilty of manslaughter if death results from the commission of an assault, criminal damage, burglary, robbery or even theft. The prosecution's task is to prove:

- u the elements of the core offence (e.g. the assault, the criminal damage, etc.)
- u the objective likelihood that harm would result from the commission of that offence, and
- u a causal connection between the core offence and the death.

This offence is, in the opinion of most commentators, unjust, since – as Illustration 7.7 shows – the criminal label may seriously overstate the gravity of the defendant's wrongdoing.

**page 87**
#### **7.4.4** *Actus reus***: constructive manslaughter**

##### **An act**

To be guilty of constructive manslaughter the cause of death must be an act. This is one of the few crimes which cannot be committed by omission. Omissions are not sufficient even where there is a duty of care. So in *Lowe* [1973] QB 702 D was charged with the constructive manslaughter of his child whom he had badly neglected. He was convicted on the basis that he had caused his child's death through the commission of a criminal offence. That offence is wilful neglect of a child (s.1 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933). D's conviction was quashed. The Court of Appeal ruled that an act was of the essence for constructive manslaughter. This charge would have been proper if the child had died as a result of injuries sustained through a beating. As no such acts could be established, the case should have been charged as one of gross negligence manslaughter. No doubt the prosecution chose to charge constructive manslaughter because it was easier to establish the commission of the s.1 offence than it was to establish **gross negligence** on D's part. The Court of Appeal saw through this ruse!

##### **An act which is criminally unlawful**

This is an important point. It was first established in *Franklin* (1883) 15 Cox CC 163 in which D killed a swimmer when he threw a wooden crate off a pier into the sea. D's conviction for constructive manslaughter was quashed since what he had done, if wrongful, was not a criminal wrong. In deciding whether someone has committed constructive manslaughter, therefore, the first question to ask is whether the death resulted from the commission of a crime. This crime must, moreover, be identified by the prosecution (*Jennings* [1990] Crim LR 588).

##### **Activity 7.9**

**Read Wilson, Sections 13.7.B.1 'The elements of constructive manslaughter', Section (b) 'Dangerous act' and 13.7.C 'Manslaughter by breach of duty' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. Why was Slingsby not guilty of constructive manslaughter?**
- **b. Lamb shot dead his friend. Why was he not guilty of constructive manslaughter? Could he have been guilty of gross negligence manslaughter?**

*Larkin* [1943] KB 174 and *Lamb* [1967] 2 QB 981 are authorities for the proposition that the prosecution must be able to prove all the elements of a criminal offence to support a conviction for constructive manslaughter. But the prosecution's task does not stop there. If D has a defence to the core offence, for example consent or selfdefence, again no conviction for unlawful act manslaughter will arise. In *Scarlett* [1993] 4 All ER 629 D, a publican, ejected a drunk from a public house who then fell backwards down the steps and died following a fractured skull. D's conviction for constructive manslaughter was quashed on the basis that he feared the drunk was about to attack him and so his use of force was lawful self-defence. This meant that he had not committed the core offence that constructive manslaughter requires.

#### **7.4.5 Constructive manslaughter and crimes of negligence: a qualification**

Certain activities are lawful if done properly, but unlawful if done dangerously or negligently. The most common example of these are driving offences. If D commits a driving offence such as speeding or dangerous driving which results in V being killed, is D automatically guilty of constructive manslaughter? This is an important question because if the answer is yes it would threaten to put a lot of people, whose only fault is negligence or absent-mindedness, behind bars. It would also take over the space currently occupied by gross negligence manslaughter and render a conviction for negligent killing easier; indeed, far too easy. In *Andrews* [1937] AC 576, the House of Lords ruled that only acts which are inherently criminal can form the basis of a constructive manslaughter charge. If they are criminal only because they are performed in a careless or dangerous fashion then the prosecution must charge gross negligence manslaughter, which will necessitate the prosecution proving not merely the carelessness or dangerousness required by the core crime but also gross negligence as to death.

**page 88**
##### **Activity 7.10**

**Lord Atkin said in** *Andrews***: 'There is an obvious difference in the law of manslaughter between doing an unlawful act and doing a lawful act with a degree of carelessness which the legislature makes criminal'.**

**In other words, you cannot charge constructive manslaughter if the only criminal wrong committed by the defendant is speeding, driving while intoxicated, dangerous driving or driving without due care.**

**Now invent an examination question in which it would be right to charge constructive manslaughter arising from a piece of dangerous driving. If you can do this, you have gone a long way towards understanding constructive manslaughter. Read Wilson, Section 13.7.B.1(b)(ii) 'The unlawfulness of an act must be constituted independently of its dangerousness', if you have difficulty but try it yourself first!** 

#### **7.4.6 The criminal act must be dangerous**

'Dangerous' is a term of art here. It does not mean threatening to life or limb; it means simply of a nature to cause harm. A punch then is dangerous because punches often result in harm, albeit not serious harm. A punch was the core activity which resulted in a manslaughter conviction in the leading case of *Church* [1966] 1 QB 59. In this case, Edmund Davies LJ gave the following authoritative definition of what counts as a dangerous act.

the act must be such that all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognise must subject the other person to, at least, the risk of some harm resulting therefrom, albeit not serious harm.

##### **Activity 7.11**

**The principle in** *Church* **should be committed to memory. It is brief and very helpful. Now try applying it to the following problem.**

**Jack lets the tyres down on Jill's car. Jill does not notice this when she returns to the car and drives off. She soon notices the problem, panics and brakes suddenly. Humpty, who is driving too closely to stop in time, crashes into the back of Jill's car, killing her. Is Jack guilty of constructive manslaughter? To answer this question, your job is to analyse the facts to ensure that all the elements of the offence are present, including in particular the dangerousness requirement as defined by Edmund Davies LJ in Church.**

#### **No feedback provided.**

The phrase 'the other person' in the *Church* quotation does not mean that the dangerous act need be directed against the deceased specifically. It could be directed against a third party, as happened in *Mitchell* [1983] 2 All ER 427 (the altercation in the Post Office queue case, see Chapter 4), but it must be of a nature to cause harm to someone. So in the above problem, it would make no difference to Jack's potential liability, if the deceased was Jill, Jill's baby who was in the front baby seat, or Humpty.

Two cases involving different outcomes from similar actions illustrate this meaning of 'dangerous acts'. In *Dawson* (1985) 81 Cr App R 150 D pointed a replica gun at V in the course of a robbery. V had a history of heart conditions and died of a heart attack: D was convicted of constructive manslaughter. On appeal, his conviction was quashed because the judge had not made clear to the jury that it could convict only if **pointing the gun** was objectively dangerous. And it would be objectively dangerous only if it was known that V had a heart condition – this had not been established.

In *Watson* [1989] 1 WLR 684, D committed burglary on a house occupied by V, an 87-year-old man who suffered from a heart condition. The encounter between D and V resulted in V being disturbed and upset, and a little later he suffered a heart attack and died. D was convicted of manslaughter. Although his appeal was successful on other grounds, the Court of Appeal made clear, on the basis of the *Church* definition, that D's

**page 89**
encounter with V was objectively dangerous, as soon as it became clear that V was old and frail. Continuing with the burglary after this realisation would therefore satisfy the dangerous act requirement.

##### **Activity 7.12**

**Would it make any difference if D had pointed: (a) a real gun that was not loaded; or (b) a real gun that was loaded? In the latter case, would it make any difference in**  *Dawson* **if the gun toter did not have his finger on the trigger? Again, to answer this question you must apply the** *dicta* **in** *Church***.**

#### **7.4.7 The dangerous act must cause death**

Establishing causation is not generally a problem for the prosecution, as was seen in Chapter 4. It will normally follow from the fact that **but for D's act** the death would not have occurred, although this is not always the case. D's act must be the substantial and operating cause, which it will not be if, independently of D's action, another cause intervenes which rids D's initial act of all causal potency. (For a good example, see the discussion of *Rafferty* in Wilson, Section 5.6.A.4 'Breaking the chain of causation– intervening cause supersedes defendant's act'). A particular causal sequence in which this routinely happens involves the supply of dangerous drugs. Supplying drugs is a criminal act and it is dangerous in the *Church* sense. However, if V self injects and this causes V's death, D (who supplied the drugs) is not guilty of manslaughter. V's free and informed act breaks the chain of causation (*Kennedy (No 2)* [2007] UKHL 38).

If, however, D does the injecting then D will be liable for constructive manslaughter if this results in V's death. Here, however, it is not the act of supply which will form the basis of the charge, but the administration of the drug (an offence under s.23 OAPA 1861). D will remain liable because no subsequent act or event intervenes, following this administration, to break the chain of causation *(Cato* [1976] 1 WLR 110).

Another knotty problem concerns acts of the defendant towards V, which triggers V's suicide. What test of causation is to be applied here? Is it 'take your victim as you find them?' as in *Blaue*; a reasonable foresight test as in *Roberts*; a daft or disproportionate reaction test as in *Williams*; or a voluntary act test as in *Kennedy*? In *Wallace* (see Section 4.3), the Court of Appeal sidestepped this question, ruling that the question to be considered in all cases where more than one cause contributed to the death is whether 'the accused's acts can fairly be said to have made a significant contribution to the victim's death'.

#### **7.4.8** *Mens rea*

As has been explained, constructive liability involves the defendant being held liable for crime A on the basis of their liability for committing crime B. If, therefore, D is being charged with constructive manslaughter (crime A) on the basis of having committed an assault (crime B), all the prosecution has to establish is that V's death was caused as a result of the assault (crime B). Setting aside proof of causation, which is a given, its first task is to prove the *actus reus* of assault (e.g. a punch). Its second task is to prove the *mens rea* for assault, that is intending or foreseeing (recklessness) unlawful physical contact with V.

##### **Activity 7.13**

**Read Wilson, Section 13.7.B.1(b) 'Dangerous act' and answer the following questions.**

- **b. What was the relevance of the defendants' age in this case?**
- **c. Do you think the defendants' age should have been taken into account in deciding whether they were guilty of the crime?**
- **d. What exactly was the crime which formed the substance of the charge and subsequent conviction for constructive manslaughter?**

**page 90**
- **e. Read** *R* **v** *F* **[2015] EWCA Crim 351. Does this case add anything new to the law as propounded in** *DPP* **v** *Newbury and Jones***?**

- **g. Under what circumstances, if any, can a person be guilty of constructive manslaughter for having caused V to commit suicide?**

**No feedback provided.**

#### **7.4.9 Reform proposals**

The Law Commission recommended the abolition of the rule in *Newbury and Jones,* which permits liability in the absence of foresight of harm. Under its proposals, manslaughter will encompass 'killing through a criminal act intended to cause some injury, or in the awareness that the act posed a serious risk of causing some injury'. These proposals were considered by the Court of Appeal in *R* v *F* (see above).

#### **7.4.10 Gross negligence manslaughter (manslaughter by breach of duty)**

People whose gross carelessness results in death may be charged with gross negligence manslaughter, the essence of which is a breach of a legal duty to be careful. Such duties do not exist in a vacuum. As we have seen in Chapter 3, for example, **where death is caused by an omission** such a duty exists only where it has been voluntarily assumed, or where there is a contract, special relationship and so on. So a lifeguard may be guilty of gross negligence manslaughter for failing to save a child drowning in their swimming pool, but not an expert swimmer who is in attendance and witnesses the whole affair.

Whether a duty exists **in cases of affirmative action** causing death is a matter of law to be decided by the trial judge. In the civil law of negligence, such duties tend to arise by virtue of the duty holder being in a position where their actions are likely to cause harm to another if care is not taken. The criminal law follows this pattern to a large extent, but the fact that a duty is not recognised in the civil law does not mean that it will not be recognised in the criminal setting. In *Wacker* [2002] EWCA Crim 1944 a lorry driver transported illegal immigrants in an airless container which led to the deaths of most of them. He was held properly convicted of manslaughter for his failure in this regard. Although in the civil law such a duty would probably not have arisen due to the immigrants' complicity in an illegal enterprise, no such stricture applied in the criminal law where deeper considerations of public policy applied. A similar result was seen in *Willoughby* [2004] EWCA Crim 3365 where D and V torched D's building for the purpose of committing an insurance fraud, during which V died. Again, although no duty of care would have arisen in the civil law, a duty did arise in the criminal law and D was guilty of manslaughter.

The modern law of gross negligence manslaughter derives from the leading case of *Adomako* [1995] 1 AC 171, in which an anaesthetist was charged with manslaughter for failing to supervise properly a patient who was given a general anaesthetic in the course of an eye operation: the patient died when, unnoticed by the defendant, his oxygen supply was cut off. The House of Lords made a number of important statements of principle in the course of this case. In particular, it deprecated the trial judge's use of the term recklessness to describe the fault element and said that trial judges should direct the jury in terms of gross negligence **only** in cases where a lack of care is alleged to be the cause of death.

It stated that the elements of this form of manslaughter were threefold. The prosecution must show:

- D owed a duty of care
- D was in gross violation of this duty
- death occurred as a result of this breach of duty.

**page 91**
#### **7.4.11 Duty of care**

As explained above, it is a matter of law for the judge to decide whether the defendant owed a duty of care to the victim. The jury's function is to decide whether the duty was broken and if the death was caused by the breach. This principle was affirmed in *Evans*  [2009] EWCA Crim 650 in which the Court of Appeal introduced a new duty situation in cases of manslaughter by omission – namely one arising where the defendant is responsible for contributing to circumstances of extreme danger for the victim. This was an extension of the principle in *Miller* in which the House of Lords had limited this duty to cases where the dangerous situation was caused by the defendant (see Chapter 3). Now it is enough that they simply contributed to the danger. In the words of Lord Judge CJ:

When a person has created or contributed to the creation of a state of affairs which he knows, or ought reasonably to know, has become life threatening, a consequent duty on him to act by taking reasonable steps to save the other's life will normally arise.

##### **Activity 7.14**

#### **7.4.12 Breach of duty**

How negligent does a person have to be to breach their duty of care? Very! In *Adomako* the standard of care was described as follows.

[Responsibility] will depend on the seriousness of the breach of duty committed by the defendant in all the circumstances in which the defendant was placed when it occurred... [The jury must consider] whether, having regard to the risk of death involved, the conduct of the defendant was so bad in all the circumstances as to amount in their judgment to a criminal act or omission.

(*Adomako* [1995] 1 AC 171 per Lord Mackay)

Note here that liability for gross negligence manslaughter requires there to be a **risk of death**. There is no liability if the risk is simply of harm/serious harm (compare constructive manslaughter).

Moreover, the risk of death has to be apparent at the time of the breach of duty. This is an important qualification and was made clear in *R* v *Rose* [2017] EWCA Crim 1168. An optometrist failed to conduct a full examination of the deceased's eyes during a sight test. If the optometrist had done so, she would have discovered that the deceased had a life-threatening condition and would have sent her for urgent specialist attention. Her conviction for gross negligence manslaughter was quashed. The Court of Appeal agreed that her failure to conduct a full examination was very negligent. However, the fact that a proper examination might have revealed a serious life-threatening problem did not mean that there was a 'serious and obvious risk of death' if such an examination was not carried out. This was, after all, a simple routine eye test. It might have been different if the patient had presented with symptoms that themselves had either pointed to the risk of a potentially life-threatening condition or provided a sign that alerted a competent optometrist to that risk. Consistent with *Rose* is *R* v *Kuddus* [2019] EWCA Crim 837. The new owner of a takeaway restaurant was held not to have committed manslaughter when a customer died due to a peanut allergy that had been disclosed to the former owner but not to him. Although he was at fault in not complying with health and safety regulations concerning allergies, a risk of death would only be objectively apparent if he had cause to believe that a customer had such an allergy, which he did not.

**page 92**
It has been argued that the offence of gross negligence manslaughter breaches Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights which proscribes retrospective criminalisation*.* This is because the line between mere negligence and gross negligence is not precisely drawn. Whether a person's conduct amounts to gross negligence, therefore, cannot be assessed in advance but only by a jury deciding *ex post facto*. This argument was rejected in *Amit Misra* [2004] EWCA Crim 2375.

##### **Activity 7.15**

- **a. Read Wilson, Chapter 13 'Homicide' and identify, make notes on and commit to memory all the Law Commission's major reform proposals concerning murder and manslaughter. Do you agree with them?**
- **b. Invent for yourself an examination problem which involves a person committing each of the three forms of manslaughter which could not be charged as one of the other forms (you will find reckless manslaughter the most difficult). Below is an example in relation to constructive manslaughter.**

**Constructive manslaughter: A hits B with a single punch to the jaw. B dies as a result of a hidden weakness in his skull which implodes under the force. What crime has A committed?**

**Now invent your own.**

**No feedback provided.**

#### **7.4.13 Causation**

The final element that must be shown to establish gross negligence manslaughter is **causation**. We have already covered this in Chapter 4, which you should look at now, but there are two particular aspects of causation that warrant treatment here. The first is that the prosecution must prove not only that death would not have occurred but for the defendant's conduct, but that it was the defendant's breach of duty that caused the death. This was the point made in *Dalloway*. The prosecution could show that the boy would not have died but for the cart driver's driving – but what they could not prove was that it was his negligent driving specifically that was the cause. For this to be established, they had to prove that the accident would not have occurred had the cart driver been driving carefully. They could not do this. The evidence left open the possibility that the death might have occurred however carefully he had driven. In other words, it might have been just one of those unavoidable accidents. That he was driving negligently could have been simply a coincidence.

The second related point concerns cases where the conduct element relied on is an **omission**. Here, the prosecution must also show not only that, had the defendant acted as he should have done the death **might have been** prevented, but that it **would have been** prevented: *R* v *Morby* (1882) (see Chapter 3). This is a heavy burden for the prosecution, as was shown recently in *R* v *Broughton* [2020] EWCA Crim 1093. Here the defendant supplied the deceased, his girlfriend, with Class A drugs at a pop festival. She experienced a bad reaction to the drugs. Although the defendant stayed with her throughout, he did not seek any form of medical assistance. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal against his conviction for gross negligence manslaughter. The key question for the Court was whether it had been established to the criminal standard that his failure in breach of duty to seek medical help caused the victim's death. The expert witness at trial testified that the victim stood a 90 per cent chance of survival with medical intervention. On this evidence, the defence made a submission of no case to answer on the basis that the criminal standard required proof of causation beyond reasonable doubt and a 10 per cent chance of death was a small chance but not so

**page 93**
small that it put causation beyond (reasonable) doubt. The defendant's appeal against conviction was allowed. It was not enough, as the prosecution had alleged, that the victim was deprived of a 'significant and substantial chance of survival'. The question to ask is whether the medical assistance **would have** saved her life. Given that there was a time lag between taking the drug and her reaction, it was not certain to the criminal standard that it would.
