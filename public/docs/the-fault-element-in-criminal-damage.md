Professor William Wilson

## Learning objectives

At the end of the this lecture you should be able to

- Identify the two different mental states, of which the prosecution must establish one, to gain a conviction
- Understand the meaning of recklessness as a fault element and, in particular, the requirement that the defendant's risk taking be unreasonable to ground criminal liability.
- Understand the considerations the court takes into account in deciding whether the risk taking was unreasoanble

## The fault element in criminal damage
The Law

- Criminal Damage Act 1971 s.1 (1) A person who without lawful excuse destroys or damages property belonging to another intending to destroy or damage any such property or being reckless whether any such property would be destroyed or damaged shall be guilty of an offence.
- The fault element here is intention or recklessness. Both carry their general meaning.

A person can commit criminal damage intentionally or recklessly.

Intention carries the same meaning as elsewhere in the criminal law.

- 1. A defendant **intends** criminal damage when it is the purpose behind their act.
- 2. A jury may **also** find the defendant to intend criminal damage when, although not it is not their **purpose**, they know it is a virtually certain side effect of what they **do** intend.

Recklessness is defined by the draft criminal code. This definition has been adopted by the courts.

A person acts recklessly with respect to (i) a circumstance when he is aware of a risk that it exists or will exist (ii) a result when he is aware of a risk that it will occur (iii) and it is, in the circumstances known to him, unreasonable to take that risk. Cl 1. Draft Criminal Law Bill

## Recklessness

- In short a person acts recklessly when he knowingly takes an unreasonable risk.
- Until the House of Lords decision in *G* [2004] the case of *Caldwell* was authority for the proposition that recklessness did not require proof that the risk of causing any damage was actually foreseen by the defendant so long as it was foreseeable (to the normal person). This was harsh on the young, and those with learning difficulties*.*
- Henceforward in cases of criminal damage where the prosecution allege recklessness as the fault element it must prove *n*ot merely that the risk *was* **foreseeable** but that it actually **was foreseen** by the defendant.

## **Closed Mind Recklessness**

• There is one qualification to the requirement that the risk be actually foreseen by the defendant. That is where it is clear, because it was so obvious, that the risk of causing damage would have been foreseen by him if he had troubled to think about it. *Parker [1977]* 

• The definition of recklessness provided in the draft code tells us that a person who consciously takes a risk of causing criminal damage is only to be considered reckless if the risk taken was an unreasonable risk to take in the circumstances. The court takes the following circumstances into account in deciding whether the risk taken was reasonable or unreasonable.

1. the degree of risk

- 2. the seriousness of the potential harm if the risk materialises
- 3. the social utility of the risk taking

- So, if the defendant consciously takes a small risk of causing trivial damage for a socially acceptable reason the jury should not find him to be reckless.
- On the other hand if the defendant takes a big risk of causing serious criminal damage for an socially unacceptable reason the jury should find him reckless.
- Matters will be more complicated for the jury when either of these extremes are not present e.g. 1. big risk of causing trivial damage for a socially acceptable reason or 2. there is a small risk of causing serious damage for a socially acceptable reason.

## **Case Study 1**

D, who is in a hurry, parks his car by the side of the road and opens the car door without thinking, and without checking his mirror. A passing car is damaged when it comes into contact with the door.

• To be guilty of criminal damage the prosecution must show that the damage was done intentionally or recklessly. It is clearly not done intentionally but is it done recklessly?

## **Case Study 2S**

- D returns to the car park to find his car hemmed in on either side by closely parked cars. He knows that he cannot get in his car without risking damage to the car on his right but he knows he may be in for a long stay if he waits until the owner arrives. He decides to take the risk. Although taking as much care as he can, he causes a small dent to the door of the other car.
- Again the damage is clearly not done intentionally but is it done recklessly? He has foreseen the risk but was it unreasonable for him to take this risk?
