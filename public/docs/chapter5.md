### Introduction*

As we saw in Chapter 3 of this module guide, criminal guilt, at least for traditional core crimes, requires both wrongdoing and fault. It is not a crime to kill someone; but it is a crime to intentionally or recklessly kill someone.

Criminal fault is necessary to ensure that conviction and punishment are deserved. It acts as the criminal law's filtering mechanism to ensure that only the blameworthy are punished. Criminal fault is of two types – objective fault and subjective fault.

**page 51**
### 5.1 Objective fault

A person is objectively at fault if they are thought blameworthy, irrespective of their state of mind at the time of acting. For example, if my son is playing football too near to the house and breaks a window, I will be tempted to tell him off, even if the breakage was not deliberate and he was oblivious to the likelihood of causing damage. I will tell him that he is at fault because he failed to conform to the family Wilson's standards of carefulness. These are objective standards which do not vary with the context and take no account of the intentions or beliefs of the wrongdoer. Negligence or carelessness are two fault terms representing 'objective fault' and are the attributes of a person who fails to conform to the standards of ordinary, reasonable people. Examples of crimes of objective fault are careless driving, dangerous driving and gross negligence manslaughter.

Many commentators feel that objective fault should have little or no place in criminal law. This is because of the importance of desert in punishment. While we may rightly criticise people who fail to live up to the standards of behaviour we expect from ordinary, reasonable people, is it fair to punish them if they were doing their incompetent best? In *McCrone* v *Riding* [1938] 1 All ER 157, for example, the court ruled that it was no answer to a charge of careless driving that the driver was a learner driver and was not able to drive as proficiently as those who had passed their test.

In his book *Punishment and responsibility* (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968) H.L.A Hart, while accepting that punishment is deserved for failing to conform to objective standards of behaviour, nevertheless argued that punishment should be limited to those who could have conformed had they put their mind to it.

What is crucial is that those whom we punish should have had, when they acted, the normal capacities, physical and mental, for doing what the law requires and abstaining from what it forbids, and a fair opportunity to exercise these capacities.

### **5.2 Subjective fault**

Traditional core crimes are, with the exception of rape and gross negligence manslaughter, crimes of subjective fault. Most of these crimes carry substantial terms of imprisonment as maximum sentences. Citizens are protected against unfair punishment by a general requirement that, when performing their act of wrongdoing, they have an accompanying **mental attitude to what they are doing**. It is this mental element which makes them blameworthy and so punishable. Put simply, desert in punishment requires the defendant to **be conscious of** the wrong they are about to perform. There is no such requirement in relation to objective fault. There the defendant is at fault simply because they did something bad or stupid, not because they consciously chose to do so.

These (subjective) mental attitudes are of diverse kinds.

- For murder, the prosecution must prove an intention to kill or cause serious injury.
- For theft, the prosecution must prove that the defendant intended to deprive someone of their property.
- For criminal damage, the prosecution must prove that the damage was done intentionally or recklessly (with foresight).
- For handling stolen goods, the prosecution must prove that the handler knew or believed that the goods were stolen.

In this chapter we will examine the meaning of two forms of subjective fault (*mens rea*) – namely intention and recklessness – and the major form of objective fault – namely negligence.

**page 52**
### 5.3 Intention

Intention lies at the heart of criminal liability, since a basic element in all core crimes is that D intended to do the act which formed the substance of their wrongdoing. To be guilty of murder by shooting, for example, the prosecution must prove **both** that D intended to pull the trigger and that D intended to kill, or at least cause serious injury. It is important from the outset to understand that intention is different from motive. As a rule of thumb, the motive provides the actor's reason for forming the intention. Criminal liability, in theory, ignores motive.

#### **Illustration 5.1**

- a. A shoots B, a police officer, through the heart in order to escape arrest.
- b. A (B's wife) gives B, who is suffering a painful terminal illness, a lethal dose of poison so that B can die without further suffering.

**In both of these cases A intends to kill B. The motive, good or bad, is ignored.**

#### **5.3.1 Basic and specific intent**

Certain crimes can only be committed with intention as the fault element. These crimes are known as **crimes of specific intent**. A crime of specific intent is a crime for which the prosecution has to prove that D intended to bring about some state of affairs by doing what they did. An example of a state of mind labelled as 'specific intent' is the fault element of murder, which is the intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. The prosecution in a murder case must always prove that D acted with one of these two states of mind.

Crimes which do not require the prosecution to prove that the defendant intended to do anything other than perform the acts which they did perform are known as **crimes of basic intent**. Criminal damage is a crime of basic intent. The prosecution has to prove that D intended to light the match, throw the stone, fire the gun and so on. But it does not have to prove that D intended to damage the relevant property by that act. If D foresaw that what they were doing might have this consequence that is a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind to support the conviction.

#### **5.3.2 Murder and manslaughter: what does 'intention' mean?**

Because murder is a crime of specific intent, we need to know **precisely** what 'intention' in this context means in order to ensure that those who commit murder are successfully distinguished from those who commit manslaughter, where no such intention has to be shown. In *Hyam* v *DPP* [1975] AC 55 this proved a great challenge to the House of Lords when considering whether Hyam was guilty of murder or manslaughter. Hyam had dropped a petrol bomb through the letterbox of her neighbour, Mrs Booth, late one night when Mrs Booth was asleep. She did so not to kill or cause serious injury to Mrs Booth but to frighten her out of the neighbourhood, since Hyam was in love with Mrs Booth's husband and wanted him for herself. Two of Mrs Booth's children died in the fire. Hyam argued that she did not intend to kill or cause serious injury to Mrs Booth or the children: her intention was to frighten Mrs Booth. This argument was unsuccessful and Hyam was convicted. The House of Lords upheld the conviction on the basis that since she acted in the knowledge that death or serious injury was likely she must be taken to have intended those consequences.

##### **Activity 5.1**

**Read Wilson, Section 6.6.A.1 'Intention and risk-taking' and answer the following questions.**

- a. How would you define intention?
- b. Do you agree with Lord Diplock's definition of 'intention' in** *Hyam*?
- c. Why do you think he defined intention in this way?
- d. What problems are created by this definition?
- e. Give an example of such a problem.

**page 53**
Subsequent to this case, first in *Moloney* [1985] AC 905 and then in *Hancock and Shankland* [1986] AC 455, the House of Lords revisited the meaning of intention. These are cases on murder but their conclusions hold good for all crimes of specific intent. In both cases the House of Lords, overruling *Hyam*, stated that if it could be shown that D foresaw a consequence as probable or highly probable and yet carried on regardless, this did not mean that D, therefore, intended the consequence **as a matter of definition**. However, if the prosecution can prove that D acted with this foresight, it can use this as evidence that the consequence was in fact intended. Why else would the defendant have continued to act as he did? Indeed, in many cases, the only evidence that D intended an outcome is the fact that it was so likely to result from D's act. The higher the degree of probability foreseen by the defendant, the more likely it was that the consequence was intended. Why else would the defendant have continued to act as he did? Indeed, if the evidence showed that D foresaw the consequence as virtually certain, the inference that D intended it might be 'irresistible'. In *Nedrick* [1986] 1 WLR 1025, on facts similar to *Hyam*, Lord Lane CJ put it this way:

Where a man realises that it is for all practical purposes inevitable that his actions will result in death or serious harm, the inference may be irresistible that he intended that result, however little he may have desired or wished it to happen.

However, the jury must decide whether the consequence was intended by reference **to all the evidence**, and not just the probability of the consequence occurring. Section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 states that the jury:

shall not be bound in law to infer that he intended or foresaw a result of his actions by reason only of its being a natural and probable consequence of those actions.

It should instead make the decision about whether D did have such an intention or foresight:

by reference to all the evidence, drawing such inferences from the evidence as appear proper in the circumstances.

Some have taken the effect of *Nedrick* to mean that if a person acts in the knowledge that a consequence is **practically certain** then they intend it as a **matter of definition. It does not**. It means that the jury will normally find it difficult (because the evidence of intention is so strong) to resist finding that D did intend the consequence, even though it may not have been their primary purpose.

##### **Illustration 5.2**

**D rapes V, a four-year-old infant. D then throws V into a fast-flowing river in order to destroy any trace of his DNA. He knows that this will certainly, for all practical purposes, result in V's death, which it does.**

**D does not act for the purpose of killing but the jury will nevertheless find it difficult, if not impossible, to conclude that D did not intend to kill V because he knew that this was inevitable and yet did nothing to stop it. If D did not intend the death of V, then why did he do what he did? He intended, in other words, the whole package.**

This approach was adopted by the House of Lords in the case of *Woollin* [1999] 1 AC 82, in which *Nedrick* was approved. Woollin threw his infant son across the room in a moment of fury, and the son's skull fractured and he died. Woollin was charged with murder. The prosecution accepted that Woollin did not act in order to kill or cause serious injury, but nevertheless argued that he intended at least serious injury. Woollin was convicted of murder. He appealed on the basis that the trial judge misdirected the jury on the meaning of intention.

The House of Lords made two very important points in this case. The first point is that in the vast majority of cases the jury should not be directed by the judge as to what intention means since it is an everyday word. The jury should be directed simply that it should find the defendant not guilty of murder unless it was sure he intended to kill or, if not to kill, then to cause grievous bodily harm (the simple direction). However, it must be explained to the jury that intention is not the same as motive.

**page 54**
The second point is that the jury should be given some guidance in those rare cases, such as in *Woollin* and in Illustration 5.2, where, although the evidence does not indicate a purpose to kill or cause grievous bodily harm it does indicate that the defendant was aware that death or grievous bodily harm might well occur. This is what the guidance in *Woollin* states. It is in the form of a model direction from which judges should not deviate.

Where the charge is murder and in the rare cases where the simple direction is not enough, the jury should be directed that they are not entitled to find the necessary intention, unless they feel sure that death or serious bodily harm was a virtual certainty (barring some unforeseen intervention) as a result of the defendant's actions and that the defendant appreciated that such was the case. The decision is one for the jury to be reached upon a consideration of all the evidence.

This direction makes clear that the foresight of virtual certainty is not intention in itself but only evidence from which the jury is entitled to infer intention, depending upon the rest of the evidence (see *Matthews and Alleyne* [2003] EWCA Crim 192). For example, in Illustration 5.2 the jury would no doubt wish to find the death of V intended. But it would be less inclined to find intention in Illustration 5.3, where D would also foresee death as a virtual certainty.

##### **Illustration 5.3**

**V is in hospital on a life support machine. Doctors have concluded that there is no prospect of recovery. X is admitted to the hospital following a car accident. X will die unless put on to a life support machine immediately, but there are none free. Y, X's surgeon, removes the life support machine from V, who is terminally ill and about to die, and gives it to X. Y knows that the inevitable result of this will be V's death. Does Y intend to kill V?**

The *Woollin* direction tells the jury that it is entitled to say 'yes' but should make its decision on the basis of all the evidence. In other words, the jury is also entitled to say 'no' if the evidence as a whole supports that conclusion, which in this case it clearly does. The *Woollin* direction is important for giving the jury some discretion (or elbow room) not to find intention in cases where death occurs as a side effect of an action otherwise quite acceptable, such as this. This is a surprising state of affairs because motive is not supposed to be taken into account in deciding whether intention is present or not.

##### **Activity 5.2**

**Read Wilson, Section 6.6.C 'The meaning of intention in the criminal law' and answer the following questions.**

- a. What is the difference between intention and motive?
- b. Why is motive not supposed to be relevant to a person's culpability?
- c. Have the courts always kept to this principle?
- d. Why do you think that courts sometimes take motive into account when they are not supposed to?
- e. In the case of** *Steane* (1947), on what ground could Steane have been acquitted other than his lack of criminal intent?

The *Woollin* direction is most important for drawing a clear line between intention and recklessness. Foresight of anything less than virtual certainty cannot be intention but can only be recklessness.

A succinct restatement of the present state of the law as to the meaning of intention and the guidance juries are to be given appears in a Law Commission Report:

A person is taken to intend a result if he or she acts in order to bring it about.

In cases where the judge believes that justice will not be done unless an expanded understanding of intention is given, the jury should be directed as follows: an intention to bring about a result may be found if it is shown that the defendant thought that the result was a virtually certain consequence of his action.

(LC 304: Murder, manslaughter and infanticide (2006), para.3.27)

**page 55**
Intention as understood by clause (1) above is commonly known as direct intention. R.A. Duff (*Intention, agency and criminal liability*. (Oxford: Blackwell, 1990) [ISBN 9780631153122]) has explained direct intention as being the state of mind of someone who when acting would consider his act a failure if the consequence did not result. Intention as understood by clause (2) is commonly known as indirect or oblique intention. This definition and that of the Law Commission should be learned and understood. It is as good as it gets and you can use it to help you find your way through the sometimes confusing case law.

##### **Activity 5.3**

**Read Wilson, Sections 6.6.A 'Everyday usage and its relevance to criminal responsibility' and 6.6.C 'The meaning of intention in the criminal law'. In each of the following questions state whether Adam intentionally kills Eve and, if so, whether the form of intention is direct or indirect.** 

- a. Adam's wife, Eve, is trapped in a car which is about to be engulfed by flames after an accident. She pleads with Adam, who has escaped the wreckage, to kill her before she is burnt to death. Adam does so by a gunshot through the heart.
- b. Adam and Eve go climbing together in the mountains. While climbing a steep cliff, for which they are roped together, Eve slips and starts to fall. The weight of Eve's body begins to drag Adam off the cliff. Adam therefore cuts the rope, causing Eve to fall to her death.
- c. Adam, sees Eve trespassing on his field about a kilometre away. In a fury, he takes out his rifle and aims it at her. He knows he is unlikely to hit her since the rifle has a range of only around a kilometre, it is not a very reliable rifle and he is not a very accurate shot. However, Adam is so angry he takes aim and shoots anyway. The shot hits Eve and she is killed.

### **5.4 Recklessness**

The mental element known as recklessness has had an undistinguished history. On numerous occasions it has been used by judges interchangeably with negligence or gross negligence, especially in the field of manslaughter. In theory, these two fault elements are very different: recklessness is a subjective fault element requiring proof of 'awareness' or 'thought', whereas negligence is an objective fault element which does not. The traditional meaning of recklessness is the deliberate running of an unjustified risk **of which D was aware**.

#### **5.4.1 Awareness of the risk is necessary**

The first major authority for the requirement that D be conscious of the risk they were running was *Cunningham* [1957] 2 QB 396. In this case, D ripped a gas meter from the wall of a house in order to steal from it. Gas escaped from the exposed pipes and penetrated next door's house, affecting the occupants. D was charged and convicted of 'unlawfully and maliciously administering a noxious thing so as to endanger life' contrary to s.23 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 (OAPA 1861). His conviction was quashed on appeal, as the judge had misdirected the jury on the meaning of 'malicious', telling them it meant 'wicked'. The Court of Appeal stated the correct meaning was that propounded by Professor Kenny, who had said in his *Outlines of the criminal law.* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1911):

*In any statutory definition of a crime, malice must be taken not in the old vague sense of wickedness in general but as requiring either (1) An actual intention to do the particular kind of harm that in fact was done; or (2) recklessness as to whether such harm should occur or not (i.e., the accused has foreseen that the particular kind of harm might be done and yet has gone on to take the risk of it). It is neither limited to nor does it indeed require any ill will towards 'the person injured.*

**page 56**
This definition was adopted in *Briggs (Note)* [1977] 1 WLR 605, a case on criminal damage to a car caused by overenthusiastic wrenching of the door handle.

#### **5.4.2 Being aware of a risk does not always require conscious thought process**

This definition is true for the few crimes of malice which still remain, of which the most important is malicious wounding, an offence under s.20 OAPA 1861. Professor Kenny talks of the defendant 'foreseeing' the risk of harm of damage. Perhaps a better phrase is 'being aware of', since it is quite possible to be aware of things which might happen without explicitly thinking about them (foreseeing them) at the time of acting. An illustration is *Parker* [1977] 1 WLR 600 in which the defendant, after a bad day at the office, slammed down the receiver on the cradle of a defective public telephone in frustration, which broke the telephone. He was fined for the damage caused and he appealed. The Court of Appeal upheld the fine saying that if D did not think about the risk of damage before he slammed down the telephone then 'he was, in effect, deliberately closing his mind to the obvious – the obvious being that damage in these circumstances was inevitable'.

The Court concluded (Lane LJ at p.604):

*A man is reckless in the sense required when he carried [sic] out a deliberate act…closing his mind to the obvious fact that there is some risk of damage resulting from that act but nevertheless continuing in the performance of that act.*

This statement applies to those who know what the risks are but 'close their mind to the obvious'.

But what about those, such as the young and those with learning difficulties, who do not or would not know them in the first place? Are they reckless? In *Stephenson* [1979] QB 695 the defendant was a vagrant who lit a fire to keep warm in a haystack. The haystack was destroyed and he was charged and convicted of criminal damage. However, D had a long history of schizophrenia and expert evidence at trial suggested that he may not have had the same ability to foresee or appreciate risks as the mentally normal person. The trial judge told the jury that it could convict if D closed his mind to the obvious fact that the haystack could be destroyed. Then the judge said 'all kinds of reasons which make a man close his mind to the obvious fact – among them may be schizophrenia, that he is a schizophrenic'. The jury convicted and D appealed.

##### **Activity 5.4**

**Read Wilson, Section 6.7.A.1 'The subjectivist stance'.** 

- a. What was the Court of Appeal's response to** *Stephenson*?
- b. 'Closing the mind' to a risk is obviously a metaphor. But what does it actually mean?

Apart from the 'closing the mind' type of recklessness, one further qualification needs to be made with respect to the requirement that the prosecution must prove conscious foresight. That is if the lack of awareness is due to voluntary intoxication. In *Brady* [2006] EWCA Crim 2413, D was drunk when he climbed on railings at a nightclub and fell on to the dance floor below, causing serious injuries to V who was dancing there. He was charged with malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm, an offence under s.20 OAPA 1861.

Directing the jury as to recklessness, the judge said:

*…where there is no issue of intoxication the test requires that the defendant should be aware of a risk and go on to take it, the risk being of injury.*

**page 57**
He then directed the jury on recklessness in the context of voluntary intoxication, saying:

…if the defendant had been sober and in good mental shape would he have realised that some injury…might result from his actions in what he was doing in the condition he was in that night.

This was accepted as a correct statement of law by the Court of Appeal.

In short, a person is reckless if they are conscious that they were taking an unjustified risk, or were not aware of the risk only because they were intoxicated but would have been aware had they had been sober.

#### **5.4.3 The risk taken must be unreasonable in the circumstances known to the defendant**

All of us take risks in our everyday lives. We run across roads, we climb trees. We play cricket, rugby, football and other dangerous sports. We drive cars. Taking risks is part of being a human being: it is not necessarily blameworthy behaviour. Risk-taking is blameworthy, therefore, only if it is a risk that should not have been taken. Lord Justice Lane in *Stephenson* explained the position as:

A man is reckless when he carries out the deliberate act appreciating that there is a risk that damage to property may result from his act. It is however not the taking of every risk which could properly be classed as reckless. The risk must be one which it is in all the circumstances unreasonable for him to take.

Whether the risk taking is reasonable or not depends upon, in particular, the degree of risk involved, the type and amount of harm which will occur if the risk materialises, and the social utility of the risk taking. Stated as a loose equation the more likely and dangerous the risk taken is, the greater the social utility of taking the risk must be to offset it. A person who drives their car at 90mph in a 60mph zone may well be driving recklessly if they do so because they are late home for dinner. However, a jury may have other views if the person drives so fast because their daughter's appendix has burst, she is bleeding to death and they are taking her to hospital. The risk here is arguably offset by the social utility of the risk-taking. To help you decide these matters for yourself ask yourself honestly 'Is this a risk that I might have taken myself in the circumstances?'

##### **Activity 5.5**

**Read Wilson, Section 6.7.A 'Recklessness in the criminal law' and answer the following questions.**

**D returns to the car park where he has left his car to find that it is boxed in by cars on either side. He knows that he will not be able to escape from his parking spot without risking damage to one or other cars. He decides to take that risk. Despite taking as much care as possible, the consequence is that he breaks the wing mirror of one of the cars. Is he reckless for the purpose of criminal damage? Who decides, judge or jury?**

#### **5.4.4 Objective form of recklessness**

For a short period at the end of the last century, recklessness took on an objective meaning. No longer was it necessary to prove that D **foresaw** the risk of harm accompanying their action; it was enough that they **should have foreseen it**. This was the consequence of the case of *Caldwell* [1982] AC 341.

In this case the defendant had set fire to a hotel while drunk and was charged with reckless arson. He argued that he was so drunk he was unaware of his actions and the likely consequences. This was the kind of argument which had succeeded in *Stephenson,* except here the reason for D's lack of awareness was drunkenness, whereas in *Stephenson* it was his general mental capacity. D was convicted at first instance on the basis of the trial judge directing the jury that his lack of awareness could not be relied upon if it was due to self-induced intoxication (see *Brady* above). The Court of Appeal agreed.

**page 58**
The House of Lords dismissed the subsequent appeal but gave a different reason, namely that whether or not D was intoxicated, it was not in any event a negation of fault that a person did not think that what they were doing was dangerous, when reasonable people would have done so. Far from it; such a failure to think **manifested fault**. Lord Diplock gave the following model direction for judges to give to juries in explaining the notion of recklessness. A person is reckless for the purpose of criminal damage if:

*(1) he does an act which in fact creates an obvious risk that property will be destroyed or damaged and (2) when he does that act he either has not given any thought to the possibility of there being such risk or has recognised that there was some risk involved and has nonetheless gone on to do it.*

The key thing about this direction is that it tells the jury that it can convict of a crime of recklessness (such as criminal damage) although D gave no thought to the risk of damage, so long as the risk was obvious; in other words, as long as the reasonable person would have recognised the risk. This definition became the standard definition for all crimes of recklessness, except for crimes of violence such as assault and malicious wounding which, confusingly, continued to require actual awareness of the dangers of causing harm on the part of the defendant (*Spratt* [1990] 1 WLR 1073).

##### **Activity 5.6**

**Read Wilson, Section 6.7.A.2 '***Caldwell* **recklessness' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. What were the major problems posed by Lord Diplock's new test of recklessness?**
- **b. Is the test simply a way of incorporating the 'closed mind' form of recklessness into the definition while ridding it of its ambiguity?**

In *G and R* [2003] UKHL 50, the House of Lords was faced with yet another case involving an unforeseen conflagration. The defendants were young boys of 11 and 12 who were away from home without permission. They set up camp in the back yard of a shop and in the early hours of the morning they lit a fire in a dustbin to keep warm. The fire spread and the shop was gutted: the boys were charged with arson.

The [House of Lords](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords) acknowledged that the *Caldwell* test of recklessness might operate unfairly for 11 and 12-year-old boys if they were held to the same standard of foresight as reasonable adults. An obvious risk for the latter would not necessarily be obvious for the former. Their Lordships had three choices: to keep the law as it was; to modify it so as to render the test of recklessness sensitive to the characteristics of age, experience and mental capacity of the defendant; or to return the law to its pre-*Caldwell* state. They chose the final option and overruled *Caldwell*.

##### **Activity 5.7**

**Read Wilson, Section 6.7.A.3 'The retreat from** *Caldwell'* **and answer the following questions.**

- **a. What reasons did the House of Lords give for overruling** *Caldwell***?**
- **b. Do you think that the House of Lords went too far in requiring the defendant to be aware of the risk they are taking?**
- **c. Is the 'closed mind' form of recklessness still recklessness or does the overruling require actual foresight of the risk in all cases?**
- **d. Do you agree with the decision in** *Booth* **v** *CPS***?**
- **e. A finds her car in the car park pinned by the car on either side. She can only enter her car by opening her car door and squeezing inside. She considers whether this creates a risk of denting the neighbouring car and concludes that so long as she is particularly careful when entering the car any damage will be avoided. She is wrong and the car is dented. Is she reckless for the purpose of the crime of criminal damage?**

**page 59**
- **f. Here is part of a past examination question.**
  - **D, who is thinking about other things, parks his car in a car park and, without checking to see if any other car is in the vicinity, opens his car door. V's car, which is close by, suffers a serious dent.**
  - **Now consider whether D is reckless, in which case he is guilty of criminal damage, or simply negligent, in which case he is guilty of nothing. Apply the law to the facts of this case and make your decision. Remember, there are two routes to concluding D is reckless: (1) D runs an (unreasonable) risk of which he is aware; (2) D closes his mind to an (unreasonable) risk of which he would ordinarily have been aware.**

### **5.5 Negligence**

It is important to be able to distinguish recklessness from negligence. As you know, the formal distinction is that recklessness, which is a form of subjective fault, requires awareness. Negligence, which is a form of objective fault, does not.

All cases of recklessness are automatically also cases of negligence. Recklessness is negligence with added fault, namely 'awareness' of the risk being run. However, not all cases of negligence are cases of recklessness because negligence does not require proof of any awareness of the risk. The two fault elements start to fade into each other when we consider 'closed mind' recklessness, because here the fault element can be established without conscious awareness, so long as the risk was obvious. This can be seen in question (f) in Activity 5.7. Clearly D was negligent but he may also have been reckless if the jury concludes that the risk to the other car was so obvious that he must have closed his mind to it.

Negligence covers a far wider field of fault than recklessness, however, since it describes a person's conduct rather than their state of mind. There are a lot of ways a defendant's conduct may be found wanting, other than by them creating a danger consciously. The Law Commission's definition of negligence makes this clear. It occurs where a person 'fails to exercise such care, skill or foresight as a reasonable man in his situation would exercise' (Law Commission Working Paper No. 31: Codification of the criminal law, general principles, the mental element in crime (1970) [www.bailii.org/ew/](http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1970/c31.pdf) [other/EWLC/1970/c31.pdf](http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1970/c31.pdf)).

#### **Activity 5.8**

**Read Wilson, Section 6.9.B 'Negligence in the criminal law' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. Apply the Law Commission's definition to careless driving. Give examples of the three ways a driver can drive negligently.**
- **b. Which, if any, of these examples might lead the jury to conclude that the defendant was also reckless?**
- **c. Can a person who lacks the skill, capacity for care and foresight of reasonable people escape liability for careless driving by relying on this lack?**
- **d. Are those who possess special skills negligent if they fail to exercise those extra skills or only if they fail to satisfy the standards of ordinary reasonable people?**

Crimes of subjective fault are often graduated in terms of the degree of commitment shown to the result. This is why murder is treated more seriously than reckless manslaughter, because D's commitment to the outcome is greater than where D kills only recklessly. Negligence, as a form of objective fault, also forms part of a ladder of gravity. There may be degrees of negligence. At the top end there is gross negligence which is the fault element of gross negligence manslaughter. To be guilty of this offence, the prosecution must prove far more than simply that D 'failed to exercise such care, skill or foresight as a reasonable man in his situation would exercise'. It must show the failure which led to the victim's death **was of such a high degree** that nothing but a manslaughter conviction would address it.

**page 60**
For other crimes, such as dangerous driving, 'extra' negligence beyond that necessary for careless driving is necessary. Careless driving becomes dangerous driving when a driver falls 'far below' the expected standard, and when such a failure brings obvious risks of danger (s.2A of the Road Traffic Act 1988).

Many other crimes have a negligence component. The most obvious example is rape for which, until the passing of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, D would not be liable if he honestly believed the victim to be consenting. The new fault element is negligence (objective fault). D will escape liability for non-consensual intercourse only if his belief that V consented was based on **reasonable grounds**.

A negligence component may also be included in an otherwise strict liability offence by the incorporation of a no-negligence or 'due-diligence' defence. For example, by s.28 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, a person has a defence to the otherwise strict liability crime of possessing controlled drugs if they can prove that they neither believed nor suspected **nor had reason** to suspect that the substance or product in question was a controlled drug. Notice here that there is a reversal of the usual burden of proof. The defence rather than the prosecution has to do the proving. The apparent justification for this is that the offence is one of strict liability and that therefore any escape from liability must be 'hard won'.

**Sample examination question**
Compare and contrast intention, recklessness and negligence.

**Advice on answering the question**

Write a skeleton answer, using either the module guide or Wilson or both, of no more than one page which includes:

- a. definitions of all three fault elements (remember to highlight the two forms of intention)
- b. three (bullet) points of comparison (similarity) and three points of distinction between intention (both forms) and recklessness
- c. two (bullet) points of comparison (similarity) and two points of distinction between recklessness and negligence
- d. one (bullet) point of comparison (similarity) and three points of distinction between intention and negligence.

### **Am I ready to move on?**

Are you ready to move on to the next chapter? You are if – without referring to the module guide or Wilson – you can answer the following questions.

- 1. What is the difference between subjective and objective fault?
- 2. Is recklessness an example of subjective or objective fault?
- 3. Define:
  - a. direct intention
  - b. indirect intention.
- 4. State the difference between them.
- 5. True or false? A person does not intend a consequence unless they foresee it as virtually certain.
- 6. Define recklessness. How does it differ from:
  - a. direct intention
  - b. indirect intention?
- 7. Define negligence. How does it differ from recklessness?
- 8. True or false? A person can be reckless but not negligent if they lack the experience or capacity to appreciate the risk they are taking.
