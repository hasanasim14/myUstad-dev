### Introduction

The criminal law has no business punishing us for our thoughts, only for our actions or deeds. Even a criminal attempt requires the defendant to have acted upon their decision to kill someone, injure them or steal their property. Until then, they are free to plan the crime, obtain the poison and reconnoitre the place contemplated for the commission of the crime*.* **It is only when they put their plan into action that the criminal law can get involved***.*

**page 27**
### 3.1 What does the *actus reus* consist of?

The *actus reus* in crime comprises:

- conduct (always)
- any circumstances necessary to render that conduct wrongful (if any are required)
- result (if any is required).

In this chapter we will concentrate on the **conduct** and **circumstances** elements of *actus reus.*

#### 3.1.1 Conduct: the act requirement

The core element of criminal liability is some form of prohibited conduct. Usually this prohibited conduct will involve **a wrongful act**. Identifying an act is therefore a key task for the prosecution. Although there are exceptions, generally if the defendant has not acted there can be no liability. This principle is known as the 'act requirement'.

#### 3.1.2 What is an act?

There are two components to acts. The first is a 'bodily movement' (American Model Penal Code). The second is that the bodily movement be 'voluntary'.

##### **A bodily movement**

Taking murder as an example, the conduct element in murder consists of any act that causes the death of a human being. The prosecution must identify and prove that such an act took place.

There is no need for an act of violence; any act which causes death will do. Poisoning the victim's drink is an act. Cutting the brake cables of the victim's car is an act. In *Hayward* (1908) 21 Cox CC 692 it was sufficient that the accused threatened and chased his victim, who consequently died of a heart attack.

The corollary of this is that if A's contribution to the occurrence of a criminal harm can be described only as 'doing nothing' or 'not lifting a finger', she cannot be held criminally accountable for that harm.

##### **Illustration 3.1**

**Noor sees Parveen, a blind woman whom she does not like, about to step out into a road, unaware that a lorry is approaching at great speed. Noor does nothing to warn Parveen, who dies in the resulting crash.**

**Here there can be no criminal liability in respect of Noor. Parveen did not die as a result of any bodily movement on the part of Noor. Doing nothing is not an act.**

**The bodily movement must be voluntary**

The second component of the act requirement is that the bodily movement is voluntary. In *Bratty* v *A-G for Northern Ireland* [1961] 3 All ER 523 HL, Lord Denning explained this as follows:

No act is punishable if it is done involuntarily: and an involuntary act in this context… means an act which is done by the muscles without any control by the mind, such as a spasm, a reflex action or a convulsion; or an act done by a person who is not conscious of what he is doing, such as an act done whilst suffering from concussion or whilst sleepwalking…

##### **Illustration 3.2**

**Yasmin is waiting at the kerbside waiting to cross a busy road. Aisha trips over a brick and stumbles into Yasmin, thus propelling her on to the road. Yasmin is injured in the resulting collision with a car.**

**page 28**
**Aisha cannot be criminally liable because her act is involuntary. She was not in control of the actions which led to Yasmin's injury.**

Where a defendant has no control over what they are doing they are said to be acting in a state of automatism. Like insanity, its close cousin, automatism is a defence to criminal liability: both will be looked at in detail in Chapter 10 of this module guide.

#### 3.1.3 Am I able to identify the act component in an *actus reus***?

To decide whether D has committed the *actus reus* of a crime you need to:

- find the definition of the crime
- distil from that definition the *actus reus*
- identify from that *actus reus* the act of the defendant which you are to rely on in establishing that *actus reus*. This is not always easy.

##### **Activity 3.1**

**Let's see if you can do this in relation to theft. Read Wilson, Section 14.2.A.1 'The appropriation', Sections (a) 'Assuming rights of ownership', (b) 'Insubstantial appropriations' and (c) 'The relevance of consent or authority' and answer the following questions.**

- a. What is the *actus reus* of theft?
- b. What does the *actus reus* component of theft known as 'appropriation' in theft mean?
- c. If V lends D his book and a week later D decides to keep and sell the book, does D need to sell the book to satisfy the act component of the** *actus reus*?

##### **Activity 3.2**

**Consider the following cases and answer the question below.**

- a. Aftab has an infectious respiratory disease. He kisses Miah. Miah catches Aftab's disease and suffers serious illness.
- b. Aftab has a heart attack while driving his car. He loses consciousness and crashes into Margaret, injuring her.
- c. Vikram pushes Aftab. Aftab falls onto Isobel who falls over and breaks her leg.
- d. Aftab is driving a car with Bella, his dog, in the back seat. Bella unexpectedly jumps on to Aftab's lap, causing him to lose control of the car and go through a red traffic light.
- e. Aftab, a practical joker, explodes a paper bag behind Adele's back. Adele falls over in fright, bangs her head and loses consciousness.
- f. Aftab, Bashir's teacher, tells Bashir that he has failed his final year examinations. In despair, Bashir commits suicide.
- g. Aftab overhears Hui tell Wen that he intends to kill Ming. Aftab makes a note of this but does not tell the police. The next day Hui kills Ming.

**Consider in relation to each of the above cases** whether**, assuming Aftab is charged with a criminal offence,** the act requirement is satisfied**. In each case you will need to identify** what the act is**, if any, whose act it is and if the act is** voluntary**. You are not being asked whether a criminal offence has been committed. This depends upon other matters such as the presence of** *mens rea***, causation and defences. If you find the answers to any of these questions difficult, read Wilson, Sections 4.1–4.4 again. Do not move on until you are satisfied with your answers and your level of understanding. If you have a study partner, why not talk about the questions with them?**

**page 29**
#### **3.1.4 Exceptions to the act requirement**

There are three exceptions to the usual rule that criminal wrongdoing (*actus reus*) requires an act. Certain crimes do not require any act at all. These include what are termed situational crimes, crimes of possession and crimes of omission.

##### **Situational crimes, crimes of possession and crimes of omission**

Although the conduct element in crimes generally is an act, there are some exceptions. Criminal liability is often based upon a failure to act as the law requires, as in failing to wear a seatbelt, failing to tax one's car, failing to submit a tax return or failing to display a licence plate. Such offences are typically statutory strict liability offences designed to regulate behaviour rather than punish moral wrongdoing. They are known as statutory crimes of omission.

Criminal liability may also on occasion be based upon being in possession of a prohibited article; for example controlled drugs, extreme pornography, offensive weapons or articles for use in terrorist offences. These again are statutory crimes and are known as crimes of possession.

The final exception is what is termed 'situational liability'. The prohibition for these offences is not some form of act but, similar to the other two exceptions, simply being in a prohibited situation. For example, it is a crime to be drunk in a public place, or to be drunk in charge of a vehicle, or to be the owner of certain types of dangerous dogs (such as a pit bull terrier) or to allow a dog to be dangerously out of control in a public place.

The problem posed by both possession offences and situational liability is that criminal liability does not depend upon the defendant having chosen to be in possession or be in the prohibited situation. In other words no wrong**doing** is required. The offence in the case of owning a pit bull terrier is constituted although the dog was by way of an unsolicited gift and although the defendant believed the dog to be of another breed. The offence in the case of the out-of-control dog is constituted although the defendant performed no act and took reasonable steps to keep the dog under control (see *Elvin* [1994] 1 WLR 1057). In relation to crimes of possession, a person can be guilty of being in possession of a dangerous weapon when they believed the article in their possession was, for example, a torch and not, as it subsequently transpired, a taser (*Deyemi* [2008] 1 Cr App R 25).

##### Activity 3.3

**Read Wilson, Sections 4.5.A 'Situational liability' and 4.5.B 'Possession offences' and answer the following questions.**

- a. Why do commentators object to the decisions in** *Winzar* (1983) and *Larsonneur*  **(1933)? Do you agree that they were objectionable?
- b. Is the decision in** *Robinson-Pierre* **consistent with** *Elvin***? Is it a good decision?

**No feedback provided.**

##### Omissions and commissions

We have seen how a failure to act may serve as the *actus reus* of an offence where the defendant is placed under a statutory duty to act as the statute requires. These are known as crimes of omission. This is an exception to the act requirement in criminal law. However, since the behaviour demanded by the statute is clearly specified and is not onerous in its demands, it is not contrary to principle.

A more controversial exception to the act requirement concerns crimes of commission. Can these be committed by omission? Crimes of commission are those crimes whose definition includes an *actus reus* which satisfies the act requirement, but whose result component can be caused by **doing nothing**. For example, the *actus reus* of murder is 'an unlawful killing'. Dictionaries define 'kill' as 'an act of killing', but also define it simply as 'causing death'. An act of killing involves some affirmative action such as a stabbing, a shooting, a beating, a poisoning, a suffocating and so on. But it

**page 30**
is possible to 'cause death' by doing nothing. For example, it is a perfectly correct use of language to say that a parent who gives her baby no food so that it dies causes the death of the child – and indeed 'kills' the child. The controversy concerns how far this principle should stretch. Only one person can pull a trigger, but every passerby who sees a baby drowning in a puddle but does nothing to help can be said to 'cause' the baby's death. Are they all to be charged with murder? How do we ensure that only the truly deserving suffer conviction and punishment?

##### **Key requirements for criminal liability**

To ensure the net of criminal responsibility is not spread too far, there are certain key restrictions on criminal liability for crimes of commission in cases of harm caused by omission.

- 1. The conduct element of the crime in question must be capable of commission by omission.
- 2. The circumstances must be such as to create a legal duty to act.
- 3. The defendant's failure to act must be in breach of that duty.
- 4. The defendant's failure to act must be voluntary.
- 5. The harm must be caused by the omission.
- **1. The conduct element of the crime in question must be capable of commission by omission**

Most result crimes can be committed by omission. This includes theft, murder, criminal damage, fraud and most forms of manslaughter. Some, however, cannot. The definitions of some offences specify or imply that only acts are sufficient. Assault is one. So in *R* v *Dunn* [2015] EWCA Crim 724 D was charged with indecent assault. What he had done was to cause a 15-year-old girl to masturbate him. The Court of Appeal held that the offence was not made out. Indecent assault requires there to be an assault. An assault requires some form of act on D's part. Here the act was the girl's, not his. D had committed an offence but not this one. This offence was causing a child to engage in sexual activity (s.10 Sexual Offences Act 2003).

##### **Activity 3.4**

**Read Wilson, Section 4.5.D.2 'Omissions: the common law approach' and find and note down for later reference some other crimes which cannot be committed by omission.**

 **2. The circumstances must be such as to create a legal duty to act**

Assuming the offence is capable of being committed by omission a successful prosecution can occur only if the defendant's omission was **in breach of a legal duty to act**. This is why parents may be guilty of homicide for failing to feed their children, or for neglecting them. They are guilty because parents owe a statutory duty of care to their children. The number of duty situations are limited. They can be found in Wilson, Section 4.5.D.3 'Circumstances giving rise to a duty to act: duty situations' and need to be learned.

##### **Activity 3.5**

**Read Wilson, Section 4.5.D.3 'Circumstances giving rise to a duty to act: duty situations' and consider which, if any, of the following cases place A under a duty to act and, if a duty does exist, what is the source of that duty. When you have done this, consider whether, on the basis of your answers, the range of duty situations is either too narrow or too broad. Write down your conclusions and the reasons for them.**

- a. A is a swimming pool attendant. He sees V, a swimmer, struggling out of her depth in the pool.
- b. A is the sister of V. She sees V struggling out of her depth in the pool

**page 31**
- c. A is the mother of V. She sees V struggling out of her depth in the pool.
- d. A is the son of V. He sees V struggling out of her depth in the pool.
- e. A is the owner of the swimming pool. She sees V struggling out of her depth in the pool.
- f. A is the mother of T (aged 10) who has invited V, his friend (also aged 10), to go swimming with him at the local pool. A sees V struggling out of his depth in the pool.
- g. A and V are an unmarried couple who live together. A sees V struggling out of his depth in the pool.
- h. A, who is supervising her child at a swimming pool, drops an ice cream accidentally at the poolside. V (a child) slips on the ice cream and falls into the pool. A sees V struggling out of her depth in the pool.

In the absence of a duty of intervention or rescue, an omission, however reprehensible, cannot form the basis of a criminal prosecution. In the famous example of Sir James Fitzjames Stephen:

A sees B drowning and is able to save him by holding out his hand. A abstains from doing so in order that B may be drowned, and B is drowned. A has committed no offence.

(*A digest of the criminal law*, 1887)

This makes it important to know whether the conduct of the accused is an act or an omission because a person's criminal liability depends upon it. For example, if in a variation of the above example, A holds out his hand for B to grasp and then removes his hand from B's grip when realising B is his deadly enemy, is this a case of omission or commission? If it is the latter then A is guilty of murder: if the former then it is nothing.

So much hangs on a simple question of definition. The usual definition of an act, as we know, is 'a bodily movement'. Since A has moved his body then, assuming death would have been prevented by maintaining his grip, A **seems** to be guilty of murder. Simple in theory, but not so simple in practice. To understand why you will need to read Wilson.

##### Activity 3.6

**Read Wilson, Section 4.5.D.1 'Acts and omissions: what's the difference?' and answer the following questions.** 

- a. Why were the doctors in** *Airedale NHS Trust* **v** *Bland* **(1993) not guilty of murder for switching off the machine keeping Anthony Bland alive?
- b. Do you think this is the right decision?
- c. If Anthony Bland's parents had switched off the machine out of compassion for his position would they have been guilty of murder?

**3. The defendant's failure to act must be in breach of that duty**

D's failure to act does not necessarily mean that D is in breach of duty. For example, in cases where D has a duty of rescue but failed to rescue someone, D is not liable for a failure to rescue if:

- they did as much as could be expected in the circumstances
- performance of the duty was impossible
- the failure to act was justified.

##### Activity 3.7

**Read Wilson, Section 4.5.D.4 'Circumstances governing the scope of the duty' and note down examples of how a person can or has avoided liability for omitting to act on the basis of any of the above three situations. Retain these notes for future reference.**

**No feedback provided.**

**page 32**
**4. The defendant's failure to act must be voluntary**

If D's failure to act was due to his being unconscious or being restrained, the failure is involuntary and cannot form the subject matter of a criminal offence even though D was under a duty of intervention.

**5. The harm must be caused by the omission**

The prosecution must be able to prove that the defendant's breach of duty **caused** the harm. In *R* v *Morby* (1882) 8 QBD 571 a parent failed to call for medical support for his ailing child. The child subsequently died of smallpox. The parent was convicted of manslaughter at first instance, but the Court for Crown Cases Reserved allowed the appeal, since the prosecution could not prove that prompt medical attention would have saved the child. Put another way, the prosecution could not prove that the defendant's failure to perform his duty had caused the infant's death since the child might have died anyway. For more information on what must be proved to show that the prohibited harm was caused by the accused's act or omission, see Chapter 4.

##### **Activity 3.8**

**Can you remember what you have learned so far? Let's see. Read Wilson, Section 4.5.D 'Omissions and crimes of commission' and then complete the following.**

- a. Name three crimes which cannot be committed by omission.**
- b. For result crimes, how does the criminal law ensure that liability for failing to prevent a result does not criminalise too many people?**
- c. Under what circumstances is a person placed under a duty to act to prevent harm?
- d. Does a sibling owe a duty to other siblings?
- e. Do offspring owe duties to parents?
- f. Do live-in partners owe a duty to each other?
- g. Do mountain climbers owe a duty to each other?
- h. Assault is one of those few result crimes which cannot be committed by omission. Why then was the defendant in** *Fagan* **v** *MPC* **(1969) (Wilson, Section 8.1.A 'Temporal coincidence') found guilty of assault when he refused to remove his car which had been inadvertently parked on a policeman's foot? It might be helpful to read the case report in the Online Library.
- i. Read Wilson, Sections 4.5.D.3(d) 'The duty to avert a dangerous situation caused by the defendant' and 4.5.D.3(e) '***Miller* **and beyond'. How does the case of** *Evans* **(2009) extend the principle in** *Miller* (1983)?
- j. What reason did the House of Lords give for deciding that if doctors turned off Anthony Bland's life support machine this would be an omission, not an act?
- k. Consider the case of** *R* **v** *Morby* **(1882). Is it ever possible for the prosecution to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that V would not have died when he did if D had sought prompt medical care? Does this put an undue burden on the prosecution?

**No feedback provided.**

### 3.2 Circumstances

As was outlined in Chapter 2 of this module guide, the definition of certain crimes requires proof that certain circumstances existed which convert what would otherwise be an innocuous act into a criminal act. Obvious examples include rape and assault, both of which can be committed **only** where the victim does not consent. Absence of consent, for these crimes, is therefore a circumstance which can convert an ordinarily quite lawful act (sexual intercourse or a simple touching) into the *actus reus* of a crime.

**page 33**
##### Activity 3.9

Look at the definitions of theft and a firearms offence and answer the questions below.

- (1) A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it; and "thief" and "steal" shall be construed accordingly. (s.1, Theft Act 1968)
- (1) Subject to any exemption under this Act, it is an offence for a person
  - (a) to have in his possession, or to purchase or acquire, a firearm to which this section applies without holding a firearm certificate in force at the time, or otherwise than as authorised by such a certificate. (s.1, Firearms Act 1968)

 **In each case state:**

- a. the prohibited conduct
- b. the prohibited circumstances.

**No feedback provided.**

##### **Sample examination question**

One very good way of learning and understanding an area of law is to answer an examination question. This will focus your reading, thus helping you to understand and remember what you are reading. If you just read, this will not be so helpful.

**Consider the arguments, both for and against, for expanding the range of duty situations which ground liability for omissions. Should there be a general duty of easy rescue?** 

##### Advice on answering the question

First analyse what the question requires of you. This question involves two parts. The first part asks you to consider changes to the present law involving the possible creation of new duty situations. The second asks you to consider whether we should stop limiting liability for omissions to a small range of duty situations and create a general duty to intervene whenever we are in a position to prevent harm.

Using Wilson, from Section 4.5.D to the end of the chapter, write a one-page skeleton answer to this question which highlights at least three reasons why criminal liability for omitting to prevent harm is thought a bad idea (or why the current range of duty situations are sufficient) and three responses to those objections. Also suggest at least three examples of duty situations which should or could be added to the present list, together with arguments against. Finally, consider the arguments, for and against, for giving everybody a general responsibility to help others in peril.

#### Am I ready to move on?

In Chapter 4 of this module guide we shall look at the other ingredients of the *actus reus*, namely consequences and causation. Are you ready to move on to the next chapter? You are if – without referring to the module guide or Wilson – you can answer the following questions.

- 1. What is the 'act requirement'?
- 2. What are the three exceptions to the act requirement?
- 3. What are the conditions of liability for a crime of commission in respect of an omission to act?
- 4. Under what circumstances will a duty to act arise?
- 5. What is the difference between an act and an omission? Why does it matter?
- 6. Why is criminal liability for omissions controversial?
