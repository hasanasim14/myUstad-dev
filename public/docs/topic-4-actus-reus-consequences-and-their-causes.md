## Introduction

Most of the crimes we examine in Criminal law require proof that D caused a particular harm: for example, injury or death to the victim or damage to their property. So how do the prosecution go about proving that D (or rather D's act) was the cause? For example, if A threatens B with death if he does not punch C, and B does punch C, is it A or B who causes C's injury? Or, if A stabs V and V is killed in a car crash on the way to hospital, is it A or the car crash which causes V's death? The principles governing causation are the subject of this topic.

## 4.1 Result crimes

This third element in *actus reus* concerns result crimes only. You may remember that some crimes do not require proof of harm. These are known as conduct crimes.

They require proof only of some form of wrongful conduct. An example is dangerous driving: a person can be convicted of dangerous driving if, for example, they drive too fast or aggressively, ignore traffic lights or road signs, or overtake while driving round a blind corner. A conviction does not require anybody to be hurt or for there to be an accident.

Result crimes, however, require both wrongful conduct and harm. So, the crime of causing death by dangerous driving requires both dangerous driving and a death. Crucially, however, the prosecution must also prove causation. In other words, it must prove that the victim met their death as a result of the defendant driving dangerously. If the death might have happened anyway, the prosecution will fail.

For all result crimes, therefore, the prosecution bears the burden of proving that the defendant's conduct caused the prohibited result. In murder or manslaughter, this prohibited result will be the death; in criminal damage, it will be the damage done to the property; in malicious wounding, it will be the wound, and so on. In this topic we consider what the prosecution has to show if it is to discharge its burden of proving causation.

In the vast majority of cases, this will be straightforward. For example, if A shoots B with a gun and B dies from blood loss, it should not be too difficult for the prosecution to show that A's act caused B's death. Similarly, if A sets light to B's house or stabs B, it should not be too difficult for the prosecution to show that A's act caused the criminal damage or the wound, as the case may be.

The prosecution's task becomes harder, however, when more than one event or act contributes to the result. In such circumstances, questions as to whether D's act or omission was the cause of the harm demand the application of legal principles. So, what are the principles governing causation in criminal law? Before we investigate further, complete Study task 1, in which such principles will need to be applied.

### **Study task 1**

Review the following cases. When you have done so answer the questions at the end. In each of the cases below the defendant (D) may wish to claim that although they did wrong they should not be held accountable for the harm that transpired because it is too far removed from D's initial act or omission. In which of the below

cases do you agree that D should not be held accountable and in which do you think D should? When you have finished the questions consider if there is there any pattern to your conclusions which could form the basis for general principles of application?

- a. D, as a joke, places a wet bar of soap on the floor of V's bathroom, hoping that V will slip on the soap. V does slip on the soap, hits her head on the floor and is knocked unconscious. Does D cause V's injury?
- b. As above except that V dies because her skull was unusually thin. Does D cause V's death?
- c. D rapes V. So distressed is V that she commits suicide. Does D cause V's death?
- d. D rapes V. When V's father finds out he kills V due to the dishonour caused to the family by V's loss of virginity. Does D cause V's death?
- e. D stabs V. An ambulance is called to take V to hospital. On the journey to hospital the ambulance is involved in an accident which kills the driver, X, and V. Does D cause V's death?
- f. D is the lifeguard on a beach. She sees V struggling in the water and dives in to save him. Unfortunately D is not a good swimmer and is unable to rescue V in time. Does D cause V's death?
- g. D stabs V. An ambulance is called to take V to hospital. The ambulance crew are on their lunch break and refuse to come until it has ended. By the time they arrive, V has died of blood loss. Does D cause V's death?
- h. D and V attend a party together. D gives V an ecstasy pill which V takes. Unknown to both D and V the pill has unusual strength. V falls unconscious and dies almost immediately. Does D cause V's death?

## 4.2 Accountability: basic guidelines

A basic rule of thumb is that where a person's wrongful voluntary act initiates a set of events which ends in harm, that person will normally be held accountable for that harm unless a subsequent act or event occurs which renders a finding of accountability inappropriate. We call the events linking the defendant's conduct with the eventual harm the 'chain of causation'. The prosecution's task is to show that every act or event subsequent to the defendant's wrongful act formed a link in the chain which resulted in the relevant harm.

If we examine case (a) in Study task 1, this produces the following analysis:

- D's act is voluntary, in the sense of being under the physical and mental control of D
- D's act is wrongful, in the sense that it is potentially dangerous
- D's act of putting soap on the floor is the first link in a chain of events (chain of causation) which results in V's injury
- D is therefore accountable for that injury unless, after the soap was put down, a later act or event occurs that renders a finding of accountability inappropriate.

The later act or event is V slipping over and banging her head. Does this act or event render it **inappropriate** to hold D to account for V's injury? This is the big question. We need to have a basis for saying either that D should be held accountable or that D should not. It is this basis which, in an ideal criminal justice system, will form the central principles governing accountability or causation in the criminal law. What conclusion did you reach and what was your reasoning?

You probably concluded that D did cause V's injury. Here are some possible basic principles which you might have adopted to explain your conclusion:

- a. D is accountable for all the consequences of their wrongful act, even if these were unexpected.
- b. D is accountable for all the foreseeable consequences of their wrongful act, and V slipping over and banging her head was foreseeable.
- c. D is accountable for all the foreseen consequences of their wrongful act and V slipping over and banging her head was foreseen by D.

Now consider the Draft Criminal Code Bill 1989, Clause 17 of which is intended to be a restatement of the common law position. Clause 17 reads:

1. ...a person causes a result which is an element of an offence when -

- a. he does an act which makes a more than negligible contribution to its occurrence; or
- b. he omits to do an act which might prevent its occurrence and which he is under a duty to do according to the law relating to the offence.
- 2. A person does not cause a result where, after he does such an act or makes such an omission, an act or event occurs
  - a. which is the immediate and sufficient cause of the result;
  - b. which he did not foresee, and
  - c. which could not in the circumstances reasonably have been foreseen.

This is a clear and generally a pretty accurate restatement of the common law position. It renders D accountable for V's injury in case (a). D did an act (placed soap on the floor) which made a more than merely negligible contribution to the harmful result (V's loss of consciousness), and everything that happened after putting the soap on the floor (V slipping over and banging her head) could 'in the circumstances reasonably have been foreseen'. So D is accountable for the result. This principle corresponds to the second of our three possible basic principles mentioned above (immediately before the text of Clause 17).

There are, however, certain aspects of causation doctrine which part company with this restatement. For example, the courts will sometimes treat a later voluntary act of a third party, or the victim, as breaking the chain of causation between act and result if it was independent and a sufficient cause of the result, even if it was perfectly foreseeable or indeed foreseen. Case (h) Study task 1 is an example. In law, D is not the cause of V's death because, although D began the chain and V's taking the pill was foreseen and foreseeable, V's voluntary taking of the pill breaks the chain of causation. It is now V's (voluntary) act rather than D's which causes V's death.

We shall now look more closely at the case law and the principles of causation which derive from it.

## Mini lecture 1 -  The Chain of Causation


In this lecture, we will talk about how the chain of causation can be broken. Students often mistakenly think that if the defendant is the factual or but-for cause of the victim's harm he's also the legal cause. This is usually so but not always. The factual cause of harm will not be the legal cause if a later act or event breaks the chain of causation, which began with the defendant's wrongful act. This act or event is known as a novus actus interveniens.

Let's start at the beginning. All result crimes require proof that A caused the result. Murder, manslaughter, crimes of violence, criminal damage require proof that the accused caused the relevant harm. Did A cause the death, inflict the harm, caused the damage, et cetera. If he did not he cannot be liable for the crime although he did something wrong with the necessary mens rea. If A poisons B, but B dies in an earthquake before the poison kicks in, A is not guilty of murder although he had the mens rea.

Proving causation is not normally an issue at trial. The facts usually speak for themselves. It becomes an issue only when there is more than one straightforward cause. Perhaps there are two assailants, one of whom takes the main role, or both fire a gun and only one bullet hits the victim, or both bullets hit, one in the arm and one through the heart. The prosecution must prove whose bullet did the damage. Again, perhaps after an attack on B, the ambulance arrived late or the doctors bungled B's treatment. Here are two case studies, which illustrate the kind of causal problems which may arise. Take a minute to look at these two case studies.

In each case Adams act is the first link in a causal chain, which ends in Eve's death. This sequence is known as the chain of causation. The court's task in these problem cases is to decide whether the causal sequence is intact or whether it has been broken by a subsequent act or event. The question it will be asking in the first case study is, "Does Eve choosing to jump break the causal chain which started with Adam kissing Eve?" The question it will be asking in the second case study is, "Does the accident break the causal chain which began with Adam stabbing Eve?"

The jury decides whether the defendant's conduct caused the harm but the judge will oversee this decision. She will direct them that the accused's acts need not be the sole or even the main cause of the harm. The defendant cannot escape liability simply by claiming that other causes contributed to the outcome. That's what happened in Pagett. The defendant who was armed and was being pursued by police marksmen used his girlfriend as a human shield. A police marksman returned fire and in so doing shot the girlfriend dead. The defendant was charged with her murder and he was found guilty.

Although the girlfriend was shot by a policeman, he was causally responsible because he started the causal chain. He was a significant influence on the eventual outcome and the action of the police marksman did not break the chain of causation. This was because it was not an independent voluntary act of the policeman but was a foreseeable reaction to what the defendant had done.

The questions the jury must ask itself in deciding whether a chain of causation resulting in harm can be traced back to the defendant are as follows. First, did the defendant's act or omission contribute significantly to the result? Second, was there any later act or event, which was independent of that act or omission and was so potent as to render that act insignificant? The first scenario where the judge must help the jury are cases where the victim's harm is made worse by an act or event which takes place after the defendant's original wrongful act.

For example, in the American case of Clark, the defendant's appeal against a conviction for manslaughter was refused when the man he attacked had been removed from hospital by his mother although she had been told by the doctor that this could kill him, which it did. Prejudicial third party acts do not break the chain of causation if the original act is still a substantial and operative cause of the resulting harm.

The same principle applies where the victim themselves make the harm worse, for example, by drinking dangerous quantities of alcohol after an attack as in Wall, or by refusing lifesaving medical treatment as in Blaue or Holland. Such acts or omissions do not break the chain of causation. If the victim injures him or herself attempting to escape from the defendant's unlawful attack the defendant will be causally responsible so long as the defensive action was attributable to that attack. In Roberts, the judge told the jury that it would be attributable to the attack if the victim's reaction was foreseeable. In Williams and Davis, the judge put it different saying that the victim's reaction would be attributable to the attack so long as it was not completely daft or stupid.

Four, a third party reacting to a danger caused by the accused's act does not break the chain of causation unless the act is extraordinary. You do well to learn and remember the following statement of Lord Justice Goff in Pagett. "The crucial feature is that there has not merely been an intervening act of another person but that the act was so independent of the act of the accused that it should be regarded in law as the cause of death to the exclusion of the act of the accused."

Since Jordan, medical interventions have not been adjudged to break the chain of causation even if very negligent since they're not independent of the accused's acts but are reactions to it and made necessary by it. In other words, they are not extraordinary. Jordan is a very rare case in which very negligent medical care given to someone who was recovering well from a stab wound was held to break the chain of causation which ended in that person's death.

In Cheshire, on comparable facts, the court ruled that negligent treatment, even very negligent treatment, will not break the chain of causation unless it is an extraordinary character. An attacker must bear the risk of negligent treatment, which causes more harm than good. Doctors are only human after all. This was the explanation given in Cheshire. When the victim of a criminal attack is treated for injuries by medical staff attempting to repair the harm done, it will be rare that such treatment could be regarded in law as the cause of the victim's death to the exclusion of the accused's acts.

This does not mean that medical interventions cannot break the chain of causation. Rather, it means that normally they will not. Medical interventions are not a special case and are still subject to the same principles as other third party reactions. Only later voluntary actions or abnormal events, which are independent of the initial attack and which are so potent as to cancel out the causal potential of that attack, break the chain of causation.

Finally, here are some examples, which potentially will break the causal chain. First, an earthquake, which causes the hospital to collapse, killing many doctors and patients. This is an abnormal event. Second, a homicidal nurse or doctor gives the victim a lethal dose of a drug. This is a voluntary independent act of a third party, such as happened in Rafferty. Third, the victim becomes infected with a dangerous disease, for example, hepatitis, while recovering from the attack. This was an example given in Kane in 1915.

Fourth, mistaken treatment, which is not a normal response to the diagnosed condition and is clinically lethal for any person in the patient's condition. For example, a negligent administration of a massive overdose of prescribed palliative drug or a lethal dose of the wrong drug. Fifth, having recovered from the attack, the victim falls downstairs in the hospital and breaks their neck. You will notice in each of these cases that although the attacker is the factual cause of the victim's death, that is the but-for cause, they are not the legal cause because of the novus actus interveniens.

## 4.3 Principles governing causation

As Clause 17 of the Draft Criminal Code Bill 1989 indicates, causation involves a two-part inquiry. The first part is concerned with how causal sequences begin, whereas the second part concentrates on how, once begun, a causal sequence may come to an end. In short, to be held accountable for a consequence involves being **both** the factual cause and also the legal cause of that consequence.

### 4.3.1 Factual cause

Hart and Honoré describe a factual cause as:

an event or act which 'makes the difference' between something happening and something not happening.

(Causation and the law (1959))

The common way of representing this is:

- an act is the factual cause if the consequence would not have happened but for that act
- an omission is the factual cause if the consequence would not have happened but for the defendant's failure to act as they should have done.

Put another way, if the consequence would have occurred just as it did irrespective of the defendant's act (White [1910] 2 KB 124) or omission (see Morby (1882), Topic 3), it is not caused by the defendant. So, Mr White was not accountable for the death of his mother, whose drink he had poisoned, when she died of a heart attack before taking the poison. Nor would White have been accountable had his mother swallowed the poison but died of a heart attack before the poison began to work. However, it would have been different if, in the latter case, the heart attack was prompted by the initial effects of the poison. In these circumstances, the but for principle operates, because the heart attack is not **independent** of the initial act of the defendant and so forms the final link in the causal chain.

To be the factual cause of a criminal harm, D does not have to start the process leading to the consequence; it is enough that D accelerates it.

Therefore, in Dyson [1908] 2 KB 454, a child was admitted to hospital with injuries suffered after his father had beaten him severely. At the time of his hospitalisation, the child was suffering from meningitis. The child died of his injuries. Medical evidence was adduced to show that he would have died of meningitis before long. D was charged and convicted of manslaughter. He appealed on the ground that he was not a but for (factual) cause of V's death, since the child would have soon died of meningitis anyway. The court said that it was not necessary to show that D was the sole cause of death, so long as his action accelerated the time when death would otherwise occur.

Through the recent cases of Broughton [2020] EWCA Crim 1093and Wood Treatment [2021] EWCA Crim 618, the Court of Appeal has clarified that, in cases of causation by omission, it must be proved that the harm would not have resulted but for D's omission. The Court of Appeal provided a lengthy consideration of causation by omission in the case of Broughton. Broughton had supplied the victim, his girlfriend, 'pumped up' drugs on which she fatally overdosed. Over several hours, he watched her condition worsen but did not call for help. The Court of Appeal quashed his conviction for gross negligence manslaughter on the basis that the prosecution had not met the criminal standard for causation. An expert testimony said that she had 90 per cent change of survival had he called for help. The CA held this significant chance of survival was not sufficient and the prosecution needed to show that medical attention would have saved the person's life.

#### **Study task 2**

Please read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 5.5.B.1 'The general framework for imputing cause'.

The question of how much acceleration needs to be established to constitute factual causation is a particular problem attached to cases of euthanasia. There have been a number of high-profile cases in which doctors have been prosecuted for murder where they have 'eased the passing' of a terminally ill patient, in other words have accelerated the time of death. Examples are 'Dr Adams trial for murder' [1957] Crim LR 365 (commentary on this case is available to download from Copyright materials) and R v Moor (2000). For interesting commentaries on Moor, see Arlidge, A. 'The trial of Dr David Moor' (2000) Crim LR 31, Smith, J.C. 'A comment on Moor's case' (2000) Crim LR 41 and Goss, J. 'A postscript to the trial of Dr David Moor' (2000) Crim LR 568 (all available in Westlaw via the Online Library).

Consider why Dr Adams was not thought to have caused the death of his patient and what change in the facts of the case would have been necessary for the court to have reached a contrary conclusion.

Show feedback

Since the doctor was only doing what doctors do when someone is in this condition the legal cause of V's death was considered to be V's condition rather than the massive dose of drugs administered to control it. If the doctor had given the patient the drugs in order to kill him then the answer would have been different.

Similarly, if the huge dose was more than necessary to keep the pain under control.

To be the factual cause of a criminal harm, the causal connection does not have to be direct. In Mitchell [1983] 2 All ER 427, the accused punched a man who had accused him of queue-jumping in a post office. The man fell on top of an 89-year-old woman, which initially broke her leg and consequently caused her death from a pulmonary embolism. The accused's conviction for manslaughter was upheld on appeal. He was a but for cause. In the words of the Draft Criminal Code, he did an act which made 'a more than negligible contribution' to the consequence's occurrence.

### 4.3.2 Legal or proximate cause

#### Proximate and remote causes

To be held accountable for a criminal harm, the defendant must, as a minimum, be the factual cause of that harm. But the criminal law requires something more to convert the factual cause into the legal cause or, as it is sometimes called, the proximate or culpable cause. This is because it is quite possible for a person be the factual cause of a criminal harm without being appropriately held to account for it. You may well have reached this conclusion in relation to case (d) in Study Task 1. Here it is again:

#### **Illustration 1**

### Adam rapes Eve. When Eve's father finds out, he kills Eve due to the dishonour caused to the family by Eve's loss of virginity. Does Adam cause Eve's death?

If anybody is to be held accountable for Eve's death (as opposed to the rape), it is surely V's father, not Adam, although Adam, because of the rape, is clearly a factual (but for) cause of the death. When the court (or you) makes a causal judgement of this nature, it is not a scientific judgement, as it is with the factual cause, it is a moral judgement. The court is being asked to consider whether the final outcome is too far removed (remote) from the defendant's conduct for it to be appropriate to hold the defendant to account. Another (non-legal) way of saying this is by asking is Adam, the person we seek to blame, actually culpable for Eve's death? In this illustration we would say that Adam does not cause Eve's death, because he is not to blame for it. He is to blame for the rape, not the death, for which Eve's father is to blame and for which he is properly held accountable.

Let's now examine the concept of legal causation in detail.

### 4.3.3 Only wrongful acts and omissions can constitute a legal cause of a criminal harm

To be the legal cause of a criminal harm, the consequence must be the consequence not merely of the defendant's conduct but of their wrongful conduct. So, if A is charged with causing B's death by dangerous driving, and A does kill B by running him over in her car, while driving dangerously, this does not necessarily mean that A is guilty of causing death by dangerous driving. The crime is causing death by dangerous driving not causing death while driving dangerously. The prosecution's task in such a case is to prove that it was only because the defendant was driving dangerously that the fatal accident occurred. This requires it to disprove the possibility that the death might still have occurred even if the defendant had been driving carefully. Such a contingency might occur when, for example, the victim jumps out in front of the car at the last second, rendering the accident unavoidable however badly the defendant was driving. This is close to what happened in Dalloway (1847), which is considered in your textbook.

Here is another illustration of this principle:

#### **Illustration 2**

Adam, a bank robber, points a gun at Abel, a bank teller. Cain, a bank customer, grabs the gun in an attempt to disable Adam. The gun discharges, hitting Eve, another bank teller, killing her.

Adam is the sole legal cause of Eve's death, although Cain is a factual cause. Cain is not a legal cause, because his conduct, in trying to disarm Adam, is not criminally wrongful. It is Adam, not Cain, who we consider to be accountable (to blame for) for the death. This is a variation on Pagett; see below.

### 4.3.4 Substantial cause

To be a legal cause, the defendant's contribution to the result must be substantial, although it need not be the sole cause. Even if a result would not have occurred but for D's acts, it is still appropriate to ask to what extent D's acts significantly contributed to the result. The criminal law ignores trivial causes.

#### **Illustration 3**

D and X, independently of each other, decide to kill P, the president of Euphoria, at a political rally. D's shot severs the aorta, causing catastrophic bleeding. X's shot hits V's hand, causing a slight flesh wound and moderate bleeding. P dies of blood loss.

Although X's shot contributed to the death and so was a factual cause, in so far as it increased the blood loss and so accelerated the time of death, the criminal law will ignore X's causal contribution as trivial. X is still guilty of a crime, but that crime is not murder. What crime is it?

This is an extreme example. In practice, it will be rare that a factual cause will be considered too trivial to be the legal cause. Most of the cases which follow indicate that there can be multiple causes of the same harm, and the fact that another cause was heavily operative does not prevent the defendant from being the legal cause if their contribution was substantial (i.e. more than trivial). In McKechnie (1992) 94 Cr App R 51, for example, there were two causes operating: an attack and an underlying medical condition. D beat up an elderly man, V, who suffered very serious head injuries and remained unconscious for weeks. Doctors discovered that V had a duodenal ulcer but decided that it would be too dangerous to operate, because he was still unconscious from his beating. V died as a result of the ulcer bursting. D was convicted and appealed *inter alia* on the basis that it was the ulcer rather than the attack which caused the death. The Court of Appeal, upholding his conviction, ruled that D was still a substantial cause of V's death, since the doctors' decision not to operate was due to the effects of the initial beating.

Two key points emerge from this case. The first is that, where more than one cause operates, as it did here, the initial wrongful act of D is still the legal cause if it is still a substantial and operative cause; in other words, if it is still strongly influential on the outcome. The second is that a later causal contribution (here the failure to operate on the burst ulcer) will not prevent the initial cause being still operative unless it is independent of the initial act. Here, the doctors' decision was not independent of the initial beating, as it was influenced by that beating. By contrast, if the doctors had mistakenly given V poison, which caused the ulcer to rupture, this would have been independent of the initial act, and so D would not have been the legal cause of V's death. Compare Benge (1865), in which D, a foreman platelayer on a railway, failed to check the train timetable to ensure the men working for him were safe on the line. A train killed one of the workmen. D claimed that he was not the legal cause, since the driver of the train could have prevented the deaths if he had kept a proper lookout. Again, although the train driver's error was accepted to be a factual cause of the death, this did not prevent the court from concluding that D's contribution was substantial enough to justify attributing responsibility for the death to him.

Sections 4.3.5–4.3.7 below set out some other categories of case where the courts will consider D's wrongful act to be the legal cause of a criminal harm, although other competing causes are present. Later in the topic, we will examine cases where the defendant's wrongful act is not deemed to be the cause of a criminal harm, because of a powerful intervening act or event which is judged to break the chain of causation linking the defendant's act with the harm.

### 4.3.5 Death precipitated by the victim's vulnerable physical or mental condition

Occasionally, the victim's death is triggered by a combination of the defendant's unlawful act and the victim's own physical or mental vulnerability. For example, in Hayward (1908), D chased the victim, D's wife, and threatened her with death. Unknown to him, V had an overactive thyroid. This underlying condition rendered her susceptible to the heart attack from which she died. D remained accountable for the death. This principle, which is known as the 'eggshell skull rule', is of general application. Simply put, D's causal responsibility for resultant harm is not deflected if V has a condition (such as a skull as fragile as an eggshell) which renders them especially likely to suffer injury or die.

### 4.3.6 Supervening acts of third parties

Acts of third parties can, on occasion, break the chain of causation linking a but for cause to a consequence. However, these occasions are rare, as we shall now see.

Acts of third parties exacerbating the harm

If a third party contributes to the harmful result, this will not break the chain of causation if D's original act was still a substantial and operative cause of the harm. In Smith [1959] 2 QB 35, the victim died of a stab wound to the lung, but not before he had been dropped twice before reaching medical attention and had received artificial respiration – which is not a good idea for someone with a punctured lung! Smith was still the legal cause of V's death. Although the intervening acts contributed to the death, Smith's acts were still a substantial cause of the harm and were still operative at the time of death. Hint: consider what the autopsy report would have said to be the cause of death.

The following statement of principle given in Smith is a very useful summary of the general legal position governing causation.

If at the time of death the original wound is still an operating cause and a substantial cause, then the death [is] the result of the wound, albeit that some other cause is also operating. Only if it can be said that the original wounding is merely the setting in which another cause operates can it be said that the death does not result from the wound. Putting it in another way, only if the second cause is so overwhelming as to make the original wound merely part of the history can it be said that death does not flow from the wound.

Acts of third parties reacting to a danger caused by A's act

It is natural that, when a person acts in a dangerous fashion, third parties may act unpredictably by way of reaction. For this reason, it will be rare that such a reaction will break the chain of causation linking the defendant with the eventual consequence. For an extreme example, see Pagett (1983). In this case, D used his pregnant girlfriend, V, as a human shield to prevent police officers arresting him. D had a shotgun with him and shot towards the police. They returned fire and V was killed. He appealed against conviction for manslaughter on the ground that the police, and not he, had caused V's death. The Court of Appeal disagreed. In reaching its decision it said:

if a reasonable act of self-defence against the act of the accused causes the death of a third party... [it does not] relieve the accused from criminal responsibility for the death of the third party.

#### **Study task 3**

Consider the case of Pagett and answer the questions below. In each case, ask yourself whether D's act was a substantial and operative cause of death; whether the police response was reasonable; whether the police response was foreseeable; whether the police response was made more likely by D's action? Remember, there are no right answers to these questions. They are simply some of the considerations the court will have in mind in deciding whether to attribute cause to the defendant when their causal contribution is not obvious. In principle, a 'yes' to any one of these questions might support D's conviction. Which question(s) do you think the court should ask?

- a. Do you think the police's reaction was reasonable? Do you think the real issue should be whether the police response was 'foreseeable'?
- b. If D had simply waved the gun in the air and the police had opened fire, with the same result, would D still be the cause of V's death?
- c. What principle would you adopt to support your answer to question (b) above?

#### Medical interventions

We have already seen an example of poor medical treatment contributing to a criminal harm (Smith). In Cheshire [1991] 1 WLR 844, D shot V in the abdomen. V was taken to hospital, where he was operated on. Almost immediately, he started suffering breathing difficulties and so a tracheotomy was performed. Six weeks later, V's wounds were nearly healed but his breathing was getting progressively worse and he died. The doctors failed to recognise and respond to the cause of V's problems, which was that the tracheotomy had been negligently performed. The trial judge told the jury that this bad medical treatment did not relieve D from responsibility. On the basis of this direction, the jury convicted. D's appeal against conviction failed. The Court of Appeal, in an important ruling, held that negligent medical treatment would only very rarely supplant the defendant's wrongful attack as the legal cause of the victim's death, in the exceptional case where that treatment was independent of the defendant's acts and so potent a cause of the death that the defendant's acts could be considered insignificant. In other words, the bar is set very high. Before you continue reading, it will be helpful to look at Cheshire and its implications in greater detail.

#### **Study task 4**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 5.6.A.3(e) 'Medical responses to the danger posed by A's conduct' and Section 5.6.A.4(c) 'When will inappropriate medical treatment break the chain of causation?' and answer the following questions.

- a. What was the response of the Court of Appeal to the appeal in Cheshire? What principle did the Court lay down in reaching its decision? This is another principle that is worth committing to memory.
- b. Cheshire was quite an extreme case of bad medical treatment yet D remained liable. In what situations will bad medical treatment rid D's criminal act of 'causal potency'?
- c. Consider the court's decision in Jordan. Is it consistent with Cheshire? If not, which do you prefer and why?
- d. If the doctors had given the victim in Smith a huge overdose of painkillers by mistake, which would have killed any patient irrespective of their condition, would this prevent the initial wound from being the 'substantial and operative cause' of V's death?

Show feedback

- a. Appeal rejected. C's shooting was the legal cause of V's death 'unless the negligent treatment was so independent of his acts, and in itself so potent in causing death that the contribution made by his acts could be regarded as insignificant'.
- b. No feedback. The section gives clear examples.
- c. It is consistent with Cheshire only in one respect, namely that the doctors gave V drugs to which it was known he was allergic. In effect, they are inconsistent. Both involve very bad treatment indeed. In Cheshire this did not break the chain of causation. In Jordan it did. Cheshire is the stronger authority.

### 4.3.7 Supervening acts of the victim

Supervening acts or omissions of the victim exacerbating the harm

If, after they have been harmed by D, V does something or fails to do something that is unexpected and prejudicial to their prospects of recovery, this will not break the chain of causation if D's act is still a substantial and operative cause. For example, in Holland (1841) 2 Mood & R 351, V, following a serious assault with an iron bar, refused to

submit to the amputation of a finger, recommended to prevent tetanus. D was held to be causally responsible for V's resultant death from tetanus. In Blaue [1975] 1 WLR 1411, D stabbed V, causing serious blood loss. Doctors treating V told her she needed a blood transfusion or she would die. V refused the transfusion for religious reasons and died of blood loss. D argued that he was not the cause of V's death: the cause was V's refusal. The Court of Appeal rejected this argument, stating that the defendant must 'take the victim as he finds him'. D's act was still a substantial and operative cause of death. Remember the autopsy report!

#### Escape attempts

If V is injured attempting to escape from D's unlawful attack, D will be causally responsible so long as the defensive action was attributable to that attack. In Roberts (1972) 56 Cr App R 95, V jumped out of a moving car in reaction to being sexually assaulted by D in the car. The Court of Appeal ruled that D was the cause of V's injuries, as D's act began the causal chain and the reaction of V was reasonably foreseeable. The Court also stated that the chain of causation would be broken only by the victim doing something 'daft'. In Williams and Davis [1992] 1 WLR 380, on similar facts, except that the result was the death of the escaping passenger, a slightly different test was used – namely, whether V's response was within the range of responses which might be expected from a victim 'placed in the situation which he was'. These two formulations, although worded differently, are designed to make the same point: namely, that the victim's reaction to a danger created by the defendant will not break the chain of causation unless it is some way extraordinary. Unfortunately, it leaves the law in a bit of a mess. Not all cases of a victim reacting in an unforeseeable way, for example, would lead us to say that their response was 'daft'. Different people do different things faced with the same threat. What is daft for one person is understandable for another. It might be better if there was a standard test – namely, whether V's response was within the range of responses which might be expected from a victim 'placed in the situation which he was'. This says everything that the foreseeability and 'daftness' test says, but more analytically. Neither test helps us that much in the case of suicide, which is considered in the next section.

Suicide

#### **Illustration 4**

Adam rapes Eve. Eve is so traumatised by the rape that she suffers clinical depression. Six months later, she decides she cannot continue with her life and commits suicide. Is Adam guilty of manslaughter?

To be guilty of manslaughter, the prosecution must show that Adam has committed an unlawful and dangerous act which causes Eve's death. Here, they can prove the unlawful and dangerous act (the rape), and they can prove the death, but can they show that the act caused the death? Is it the rape that caused the death or is the suicide of Eve's own choosing? On the face of it, the tests of causation seem to support the view that Adam caused Eve's death. Suicide is a foreseeable, if rare, response to a rape, and if we ask the question 'is suicide "within the range of responses which might be expected from" a rape victim?' we would probably say yes. Trauma of this kind can trigger extreme responses, particularly in the vulnerable. On the other hand, suicide is generally the result of life's vicissitudes affecting people's mental states and their sense of purpose. Poverty, loneliness, trauma and a sense of futility can all lead people to commit suicide, but we don't tend to think that these factors actually 'cause' the death. Rather, they provide explanations as to why death was chosen by the deceased. This is how the criminal law looks at the matter. To be the cause of suicide, there must be a sufficiently strong link between the wrongful act and the death to allow us to attribute the death directly to the act. Usually, this will mean that there is a close temporal connection between the wrongful act and the death.

In Dhaliwal [2006] EWCA Crim 1139, a case involving suicide following a long period of domestic abuse, the Court of Appeal put it this way:

where a decision to commit suicide has been triggered by a physical assault which represents the culmination of a course of abusive conduct, it would be possible...to argue that that final assault played a significant part in causing the victim's death.

In other words, if the suicide was simply the victim choosing death over a miserable, abused life, the defendant would not be responsible for her death. It is only where the suicide was triggered by a particular wrongful act that the jury would be entitled (not bound) to find causation proved. In 2017, another case ( $R \vee$  Wallace [2018] EWCA Crim 690) was decided involving a suicide influenced by the defendant's wrongful act. The defendant threw concentrated sulphuric acid over her former lover while he was sleeping. This left him blind, paralysed and suffering from catastrophic injuries and pain. Two years later, he checked into a euthanasia clinic in Belgium, where euthanasia is legal, and his life was terminated. He had decided that he could not continue to live with his injuries and the pain to which he was still subject. The defendant was charged with murder, and the trial judge refused to allow the question of causation to be considered by the jury, on the ground that there was too long a delay between the act and the death. The jury convicted the defendant of throwing corrosive fluid on a person, with intent to do grievous bodily harm, an offence under s.29 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.

On appeal, the Court of Appeal ruled that the trial judge was wrong to withdraw the question of causation from the jury. It was open to the jury to conclude that, despite the separation in time between the throwing of the acid and the death, the acts of the victim were a direct response to the injuries inflicted, for which the defendant was directly responsible. It said that the question to be considered in all cases where more than one cause contributed to the death is whether 'the accused's acts can fairly be said to have made a significant contribution to the victim's death'. A retrial was ordered, but in June 2018 the jury again acquitted of murder and convicted of the s.29 offence. Do you see a difference between Wallace and Dhaliwal which accounts for the different responses of the Court of Appeal in these two cases?

### Discussion activity 1

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 5.6.A 'Subsisting conditions' and consider whether Adam is the legal cause of V's death? In other words, is there any significance difference between this case and Blaue that warrants Blaue being distinguished? Please note here that there is no right answer. Questions about whether the factual cause of a criminal harm is also the cause recognised by the law is a matter of moral and common-sense judgement - so exercise yours!

- a. Why was Blaue the cause of V's death when V could have easily prevented it by agreeing to a blood transfusion?
- b. Eve asks Adam, her husband, to shoot her because she is terminally ill and wishes to die. Adam does so out of compassion and respect for her wishes. However, his shot fails to kill her but causes massive internal bleeding. Adam then realises that he does not want to be responsible for Eve's death so he takes her to hospital. The hospital tells Eve that she needs a blood transfusion and that she will die without it. Eve refuses, as she still wants to die – which she does.

### Mini lecture 2 -  HOW CAN THE CHAIN OF CAUSATION BE BROKEN? Prof William Wilson

This mini-lecture addresses the chain of causation and how it can be broken. I shall begin by reminding you of the basic principles of causation.

A chain of causation begins with the defendant's wrongful act or omission. It ends with a victim's death or other harm unless something happens subsequently to break the chain. The chain of causation generally remains unbroken, although other causes intervene following defendant's wrongful act. The questions the jury must ask itself in deciding whether a chain of causation resulting in harm can be traced back to the defendant are as follows.

First, did the defendant's wrongful act or omission contribute significantly to the result? Second, if so, was there any later act or event which was independent of that act or omission and was so potent as to render that act insignificant? Three, the cases referred to on this slide are cases where an initial wrongdoer was found to be the legal cause of an event, although there were other causal forces at work.

When will a subsequent act or event break the chain of causation?

A causal sequence may be broken by an independent voluntary act of the victim or a third party, or by an abnormal event sufficient in itself to cause the result. Where this occurs, the original but for cause will be ignored. Such an act or event is known as a novus actus interveniens or a new act intervening. Take a moment to look at these two illustrations.

In case 1, X's intervening act is sufficient in itself to cause V's death. It is voluntary and it is entirely independent of D's original act. We might call this a complete coincidence.

We begin with cases where the victim's own act breaks the chain of causation. Most of the decided cases involve a victim self-administering dangerous substance, which was supplied by the defendant. Following the template given earlier, this act of supply begins the chain of causation, which ends in the victim's death.

The leading case is *Kennedy*. K supplied V with heroin for injection. V injected himself with it and died due to its exceptional purity. K was charged with manslaughter. His conviction turned on whether his unlawful act of supply had caused V's death. The House of Lords quashed the conviction. Although K's act began the causal chain, it was broken by V's voluntary act. V injected himself of his own free will and knew what he was doing. It was a free and informed decision but what does free and informed mean?

Obviously, children and the mentally ill cannot make free and informed decisions, but when else? This was the point considered by the Court Of Appeal in *Rebelo*. The appellant, A, supplied diet pills to the deceased, EP. EP was addicted to these pills, although she knew they were dangerous in large quantities. EP also had a history of self-harming. She overdosed and died of a heart attack. A was convicted of her manslaughter.

The case turned on whether A had caused EP's death or whether as in Kennedy, she had caused her own death. Following a retrial, A was convicted of gross negligence manslaughter. The question for the Court Of Appeal was whether the judge had properly directed the jury on causation.

Dame Victoria Sharp, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal approved the judge's direction at the retrial. This direction took full account of the fact that EP suffered mental health problems relating to her weight. Also that she was addicted to the drug, which was relevant to the question as to whether the injection was voluntary and finally, the fact that she was informed as to the risks involved. The court ruled therefore that the direction was good and that the conviction was safe.

The case of *Field* also highlights the problems attached to deciding whether the victim's selfdestructive act was free and informed. The deceased was deceived by Field into taking a fatal amount of drink and drugs. The deceased believed Field loved him, whereas in reality, Field was after his money and wanted to kill him. Field was convicted of murder. He appealed the judge's direction on causation. The Court of Appeal ruled that it was open to the jury to conclude that his deception may have prevented a free, voluntary and informed decision by the deceased. He thought he was in safe hands, but in reality, he was being seduced into killing himself.

A related problem concerns cases where following an act of violence such as rape or a disfiguring injury by the accused, the victim commits suicide. In *Wallace*, the deceased was caused catastrophic injuries when his jilted partner threw acid over him while he slept. A year later, unable to live with terrible pain, the deceased visited a euthanasia clinic where he was euthanized.

On this slide, we find an extract from the judgment of Lord Justice Sharp concerning the correct direction to be given to the jury in a case when the defendant's act of violence prompts the victim to commit suicide. Stop the tape now and read the extract carefully.

Please note that there is no mention of whether V's decision to be euthanized was voluntary, that is whether it was free and informed. In such a case as this, it would mean very little. Instead, the judge talks about whether the throwing of the acid was a substantial cause of the death and whether the victim's response was foreseeable. Such a direction is appropriate for cases of induced suicide, but not more generally where the *Kennedy* approach should be followed.

We turn now to cases where it is a third party who breaks the chain of causation. It will do so in line with *Kennedy* where the third party's intervening act is voluntary and independent of the accused act, where, as I put it earlier, the later act is a complete coincidence. An example occurred in the American case of *Elder*. In this case, D struck V, then a bystander who was not part of any plan to hurt V stepped up and kicked V killing him. D, although he began the chain of causation, was not guilty of homicide. The chain of causation was broken by the bystander's voluntary and independent act.

Now this principle that acts of strangers break the chain of causation if they're voluntary and independent does not apply in strict liability offenses if the harm was still attributable to the defendant's commercial activities. Authority for this is *Environmental Agency v Empress Cars*. In this case, vandals opened a tap on the defendant company's oil tank. As a result, oil leaked into a river causing pollution. The company was charged with causing the oil to pollute the river. The House of Lords upheld the conviction. The company argued that they did not cause the pollution. It was caused by the independent and voluntary acts of the vandals. The House of Lords rejected the argument. Both vandals and the company caused the pollution.

Why then was the company prosecuted? The House of Lords said that it was prosecuted and properly convicted because such an intervention was reasonably foreseeable and the company was in the best position to prevent the trespassers' action. As a result, the company could not defend themselves by saying the release was not their doing.

The third instance of a novus actus interveniens is an abnormal event. An abnormal event may break the chain of causation if it is independent of the accused's act, that is a complete coincidence. An illustration is the American case of *Bush* in which it was held that where a wounded man contracted scarlet fever from his surgeon, the chain of causation linking the wound with the death was broken since scarlet fever was not the natural consequence of the wound.

Compare this case with *Corbett* where the defendant's initial wrongdoing made the eventual death more likely to occur. D and V became involved in a fight. V ran away from D, fell in the gutter probably because he was drunk, and received fatal injuries when he was struck by a passing vehicle. D's appeal against his conviction for manslaughter was dismissed. Following *Roberts*, if V's response had been within the range of foreseeable responses, D's attack was a cause of his death.

## 4.4 Breaking the chain of causation

So far, you will be forgiven for thinking that nothing can prevent the attribution of legal cause to a person whose culpable act began a chain of causation which ended with the victim's death or other harm. However, in certain circumstances, the chain of causation linking act and result can be broken. It can be broken by an act or an event which, in the words of the Draft Criminal Code, was neither foreseen nor foreseeable or, in certain circumstances, by the voluntary actions of the victim or third party – whether foreseeable or not.

An act or event which breaks the chain of causation is known as a novus actus interveniens, or a new act intervening. We will now examine the special characteristics of a novus actus interveniens, of which the case of Jordan (1956) is an unusual example. On facts similar to Cheshire, the court ruled that the intervening causal contribution of a third party was 'palpably wrong' and so powerful and independent of the initial wrongful act of the defendant that that act was no longer fairly treated as the cause of death. The main distinguishing feature was that here the initial wound had almost healed, but the doctors treating the deceased gave him drugs to which they knew him to be intolerant and, to help his recovery from the drugs, put him on a saline drip which, through their negligence, introduced too much fluid into his body, causing death by pneumonia.

When will a subsequent act or event break the chain of causation? This depends upon whether the intervening event is an act or a natural occurrence.

### 4.4.1 New acts intervening

An intervening act of a third party will break the chain of causation if it is:

- · voluntary
- independent of the initial act, and
- sufficient in itself to cause the harm suffered by the victim.

At least one of these requirements was arguably unsatisfied in Jordan: namely that, although the doctor's intervention was 'palpably wrong', it was not independent of the initial act. It was part of the continuing treatment (albeit negligent treatment) that the victim was receiving due to the initial attack. For this reason, Jordan is widely considered to be a bad decision. A less controversial example occurred in the American case of People v Elder (1894). D struck V and V collapsed on the ground. Then a bystander, B, who had happened upon the scene and was not part of any plan to hurt V, stepped up and kicked V, killing him. D was not guilty of homicide. Although

D was a factual cause of the death, the independent and voluntary act of B broke the chain of causation. A more modern example is the English case of Rafferty [2007] EWCA Crim 1846, which you will find in Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 5.6.A.4 'Breaking the chain of causation – intervening cause supersedes defendant's act'.

The requirement that the act of the third party be independent of D's act is best illustrated by the cases of Pagett and Cheshire. The acts of the police officers in Pagett, and the medics in Cheshire, did not involve new acts intervening because they were by way of reaction to D's wrongful act. They were not independent of it. This principle also lay at the heart of Wallace, above, although here the relevant reaction was of the victim rather than the third party. In deciding that the jury should have been asked to consider whether the defendant's wrongful act was a cause of the deceased's suicide the Court of Appeal emphasised the obvious connection between the suicide and the catastrophic injuries the defendant had caused the deceased. Crucially and significantly, questions of voluntariness were not part of the Court of Appeal's reasoning as they were in Kennedy. The question to be considered in all cases where more than one cause contributed to the death (including victim reaction), is whether 'the accused's acts can fairly be said to have made a significant contribution to the victim's death'. This, of course, is simply a different way of accounting for a causal connection such as was used, using a foreseeability test, in Roberts, above.

This principle that voluntary acts of strangers break the chain of causation) does not apply in strict liability offences if the harm was attributable to the defendant's commercial activities. In Environmental Agency y Empress Car Co. Ltd [1998] UKHL 5 vandals opened a tap on the defendant company's oil tank. As a result, oil leaked into a river causing pollution. The company was charged with causing the oil to pollute the river. This is as clear a case of a voluntary and independent act of a third party as could be imagined. However, the House of Lords upheld the conviction, finding that both the vandals and the company caused the pollution. The vandals because it was their voluntary act and the company because such an intervention was reasonably foreseeable. The best explanation as to why a voluntary and independent act of a third party breaks the chain of causation in offences against the person but not in cases of environmental offences is the policy consideration that the company made profit from the oil and they were in the best position to prevent environmental damage like this from occurring. The company could not defend themselves by saying the release was not their doing. They should have done more to prevent it.

#### **Study task 5**

Why do you think the jury acquitted the defendant of murder in *Wallace* given that the Court of Appeal thought there was a good case that she had caused the deceased's suicide?

The chain of causation in cases of intervening voluntary and independent acts is broken only if the intervening act was sufficient in itself to kill V. If V's death occurred only because V was already weakened by the initial attack, the chain of causation will not be broken, as D's initial act will still be an operative and substantial cause.

#### Intervening acts of the victim

As we have seen, unpredictable reactions of the victim to the defendant's wrongdoing do not generally break the chain of causation, because they are not deemed to be independent of the initial act which is still an operative cause: see Holland, Roberts and Blaue, for example.

The most important cases of intervening acts of the victim breaking the chain of causation involve drug supply. In a number of cases in the past 30 years, the supplier of drugs to a person who has died following self-injection has been charged with manslaughter. The main question for the court is whether the unlawful act of supply causes the death. If we apply the usual rule of foreseeability (see Roberts and the Draft Criminal Code), the supply is the legal cause of death. However, supplying drugs to someone does not **cause them** to take the drugs. It is their choice. In other words, the cause of death seems to be the voluntary act of the victim in self-injecting the drugs, rather than that of the supplier in supplying them to the victim.

For a number of years, the courts could not decide which test to apply. In *Finlay* [2003] EWCA Crim 3868, the Court of Appeal said that the supplier had caused the death because it was foreseeable that the recipient would self-inject. The position now, following Kennedy (No 2) [2007] UKHL 38, is that the test is not whether the victim's act was foreseeable but whether it was voluntary. A free and informed choice to self-inject the drug breaks the chain of causation.

But what does a free and informed choice mean? When a person decides to take dangerous amounts of drink and drugs, what could render that decision 'unfree or uninformed'? Clearly, if the deceased had been a child or suffered a mental incapacity, the conviction would have stood as then there would have been no full understanding of what they were doing and the potential consequences. But when else might the deceased's choice be so compromised by the context that a decision to self-administer dangerous quantities of drink or drugs could not be considered 'free, informed and voluntary'?

Two cases decided in 2021 provide important insights into this question. In R v Rebelo (Bernard) [2021] EWCA Crim 306 the deceased was addicted to diet tablets. EP was counselled by a friend against taking the drugs, which are potentially lethal when taken in quantity but she told the friend she was psychologically incapable of resisting. The next day she went on an eating binge followed by taking a large number of DNP pills supplied by the defendant. She became unwell, was hospitalised and later died of a heart attack. The defence argued that EP

was an adult who, although emotionally unstable and subject to an eating disorder, made a fully free, voluntary and informed decision to take the drug. She was not acting under any compulsion and was well informed about the risks of taking it. Following a retrial, the defendant was convicted of gross negligence manslaughter. The major question for the Court of Appeal was whether the judge had properly directed the jury on causation. The Court of Appeal, approved the judge's direction, which took account both of the fact that EP was addicted to the drug, relevant to the question as to whether the injection was free and voluntary and of the fact that she was informed as to the risks involved. The Court concluded that the jury had been properly directed on these matters and that the conviction was safe.

In R v Field [2021] EWCA Crim 380 the defendant, D, set about seducing an elderly man, V, with a view to exploiting him financially. He plied V with drink and drugs over a long period and succeeded in influencing him to change his will in D's favour, all while purporting to be his close friend. One evening, once this had been effected, he executed his intention to kill V by offering him sleeping tablets and a full bottle of whisky, which he knew V would be tempted to consume. V did so and died of acute alcoholic poisoning. The major question for the court, on a charge of murder, was, again, one of causation. If V's consumption of the alcohol and drugs was voluntary, free and informed then causation was not made out, following the principle in Kennedy (No 2) and the murder charge would fail. The trial Judge ruled directed the jury that, although the victim voluntarily consumed the alcohol and/or medication, the appellant could still be quilty of murder. This was not a case, such as Kennedy, where the victim knew exactly what he was letting himself in for in injecting the drug. Rather, this victim was being duped into believing he was in safe hands in the company of a person who loved him, whereas in fact he was being drawn into a dangerous situation in the company of an individual whose object was murder. In short, he lacked an informed appreciation of the 'truly perilous nature of what was occurring'. The Court of Appeal, agreeing with this analysis, upheld the conviction. These two cases seem to qualify the effect of Kennedy, since juries are being directed in such a way that they may find a free choice compromised by addiction and an informed choice compromised by a deception.

A further qualification should be made. If the supplier witnesses the victim losing consciousness and fails to do anything to remedy the situation, a different, causal inquiry may result in the supplier's conviction for manslaughter. In such a case, the supplier's omission in breach of duty rather than the act of supply (see Evans in Topic 3) will be the new intervening cause of death.

## 4.4.2 Intervening events

An intervening event will break the chain of causation if it is:

- abnormal
- independent of D's act (i.e. a complete coincidence), and
- sufficient in itself to cause the death or other harm.

This would apply to case (e) in Study task 1, the ambulance case. It would also apply if V died in hospital due to an earthquake or contracted a fatal illness independent of their condition. For example, in Bush v Commonwealth (1880), V died of scarlet fever contracted in hospital following D's attack. D was held not to be the cause of death.

However, an intervening event will not break the chain of causation if the risk of it happening was created by or increased by D's act. For example, if D leaves V unconscious by the side of the road and V later stumbles on to the road and into the path of a passing car (Corbett [1996] Crim LR 594), or if D leaves V on the beach and the tide comes in and drowns V, or if D leaves V in a cemetery and a wild animal attacks V (The Harlot's Case (1560)), D will remain causally accountable for the resulting harm, death or serious injury, as the case may be.

#### Drag the words into the correct boxes to complete this summary of R v Kennedy [2007] UKHL 38; [2007] 3 WLR

The case of R v Kennedy was heard in _______________________ . Kennedy had been convicted supplying a class A drug and _______________________. He had supplied drugs to a man who self-injected those drugs and subsequently died of an overdose. The key issue on appeal was whether there was a _______________________ between Kennedy's acts and V's death. The court said that here heroin was self-administered, not jointly administered.  

The court was asked the following question: "When is it appropriate to find someone guilty of _______________________ where that person has been involved in the supply of a class A controlled drug, which is then _______________________ and _______________________ self-administered by the person to whom it was supplied, and the administration of the drug then causes his death?" To this, the court answered: "In the case of a _______________________ and _______________________ adult never".                          

In other words, following the case of Kennedy, self-injection _______________________ the chain of causation Kennedy's  conviction was

The chain of          refers to the sequence of events that links the defendant's wrongful act Manslaughter or omission to the resulting harm. 

The branch of law that deals with offences committed against the public, society, or the state is the     law. 

___________________________ , associated with the 'but for' test from the case of R v White, refers to a causation consequence that would not have occurred but for the actions of the defendant. 

_______________________ , goes beyond factual cause and involves a judgment of whether the defendant should be held legally responsible for the harm caused and whether their actions were significant, blameworthy contribution to the cause as per cases of Smith and Benge.

_______________________, or a new act intervening, refers to an act or event that occurs after the defendant's act or omission and breaks the chain of causation.

_______________________ are offences where the result rather than actions are the basis of criminal liability e.g. criminal damage.

_______________________ refers to the level of contribution that the defendant's act or omission makes to the resulting harm.

## Exam question activity 1

Try to answer the following examination question:

*'There is one coherent thread underpinning the case law in the field of causation, which is that people should be held accountable for the consequences of their own unlawful actions unless it would be clearly inappropriate for reasons of morality, common sense or otherwise.'*

Discuss.

A tip for the future! When answering essay questions, always begin by taking a minute to consider 'what is this question asking me to do?'. This is absolutely essential in any essay question practice.

Essay questions always invite you to provide critical discussion on the topic, including the following in the discussion:

- 1. critical evaluation: this requires you to discuss and assess the rules on causation
- 2. discussion addressing the quote directly;
- 3. using the above discussion to form an argument on the statement made in the quote, do you agree with that 'coherent thread' notion?

A tip for the future 2! When writing an outline for you answer, always structure your answer in the following order:

- 1. introduction should include:
  - context for the essay
  - a clear idea of the angle/position/argument to be adopted/applied
  - an indication of the structure
- 2. main body of discussion (the discussion the most important part) should include:
  - Clear structure
  - Coherent development of a legal argument or reasoning
  - Evidence (statute, cases, academic commentary, reports)
- 3. conclusion should include:
  - Draw the discussion together
  - Not be a substitute for the legal reasoning you should do throughout the essay
  - Not draw a rabbit out of the hat! Give your best thoughts and arguments in the main body.

Feedback is available but try to answer on your own first. Your response will not match the feedback exactly but you should compare your performance with it and consider whether you took all the relevant factors into account.

Topic 4 - Exam question activity 1

## Quick quiz 1

View Mini Lecture 1 'The Chain of Causation' and read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 5.6.A 4 (c) 'When will inappropriate medical treatment break the chain of causation?'.

On the basis of these two sources which TWO of the following acts or events are most likely to be adjudged to break th chain of causation leading to Eve's death, following an unlawful stabbing of Eve by Adam.

- □ The doctor treating Eve gave her antibiotics to which she was allergic which resulted in a fatal anaphylactic shock 
- □ While recovering in a ward Eve was stung by a wasp, to which she was allergic, which resulted in a fatal anaphylactic shock.
- □ When treating Eve for her injuries, the doctor, mistakenly administered a huge and fatal overdose of painkillers having misread the correct dosage due to intoxication.
- □ Ambulance does not arrive on time because the driver was involved in an accident on the way to the scene due to his own carele driving.
- □ On arrival at hospital Eve was not examined by a doctor for three hours. If she had been examined within an hour she would hav survived.
