### **12.1 Theft**

The law relating to property offences was codified in 1968 in the form of the Theft Act, which aimed to simplify, consolidate and reform the previous ragbag of property offences. It was only partially successful. While the law of theft, burglary, robbery and handling remains largely as enacted, the law relating to fraud was found not fit for purpose and was replaced first in the Theft Act 1978, and then again in the Fraud Act 2006.

Theft, and the elements thereof, are defined in ss.1–6 of the Theft Act 1968 although, as will be seen, the Act does not purport to give a comprehensive definition of the various conduct and mental elements. Theft is defined in s.1 as:

A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it.

Following the usual criminal template, therefore, the *actus reus* of theft is the appropriation of property belonging to another; and the *mens rea* is dishonesty as to the appropriation together with an intention permanently to deprive the owner of the property. Each of these elements will be examined in turn, beginning with the *actus reus* which comprises three elements – all of which the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt.

- u There must be property.
- u The property must be appropriated by the defendant.
- u The property appropriated must belong to another at the time of the appropriation of it.

#### **12.1.1** *Actus reus***: theft**

##### **Property**

There is a comprehensive definition of property in s.4 of the Theft Act 1968. Subsection 4(1) gives us a general statement to the effect that property:

includes money and all other property, real or personal, including things in action and other intangible property.

Subsection 4(2) then qualifies subsection (1) by severely restricting the scope of stealable land (real property). The reason for this is simple. It is not generally possible to appropriate a parcel of land since land cannot disappear as watches and handbags can. If your neighbour appropriates one metre of your garden for their garden, your remedy is in civil trespass, not criminal theft.

Real property means land and interests in land, such as a tenancy. Personal property means material objects which can (as a rule) be bought and sold; for example furniture, clocks, pictures, food, books, clothes and so on. Things in action are not material objects but are things of value which can be liquidated into money and enforced in the courts. A debt is a good example.

##### **Activity 12.1**

**Read Wilson, Section 14.2.A.2 'Property: general definition', Section (b) 'Things in action and other intangible property' and answer the following question.**

**A takes B's cheque for £100 given to B by C as payment for a bicycle. A pays the cheque into her bank account, causing a transfer of funds from C's account to A's account. What has A stolen?**

Subsection 4(2)(a) states the general rule that land and interests in land cannot be stolen and its exceptions.

(2) A person cannot steal land, or things forming part of land and severed from it by him or by his directions, except in the following cases, that it to say –

**page 166**
(a) when he is a trustee or personal representative, or is authorised by power of attorney, or as liquidator of a company, or otherwise, to sell or dispose of land belonging to another, and he appropriates the land or anything forming part of it by dealing with it in breach of the confidence reposed in him…

This exception is intended to cover cases such as that of an executor of a will who, instead of transferring the land to the intended beneficiary, sells it for their own purposes.

Subsections 4(2)(b)and (c) make a further qualification to deal with the case of people who steal things from off the land which formed part of the land at the time of the appropriation. So, a person can steal land if:

- (b) when he is not in possession of the land [he] appropriates anything forming part of the land by severing it or causing it to be severed, or after it has been severed; or
- (c) when, being in possession of the land under a tenancy, he appropriates the whole or part of any fixture or structure let to be used with the land.

Subsection 4(2)(b) deals with the case of **trespassers** who, for example, steal turf or topsoil, garden trees or shrubs, garden fixtures such as fountains or stone terraces, or parts of the house such as lead from the roof or a fireplace or staircase.

Subsection 4(2)(c) deals with the case of **tenants**, who cannot steal turf or topsoil, garden trees or shrubs, but can steal fixtures such as fountains and stone terraces.

Subsections 4(3) and (4) deal with another exception. Again, the property concerned is not land itself but is a thing forming part of the land.

- (3) A person who picks mushrooms growing wild on any land, or who picks flowers, fruit or foliage from a plant [including shrubs or trees] growing wild on any land, does not (although not in possession of the land) steal what he picks, unless he does it for reward or for sale or other commercial purpose.
- (4) Wild creatures, tamed or untamed, shall be regarded as property; but a person cannot steal a wild creature not tamed nor ordinarily kept in captivity, or the carcase of any such creature, unless either it has been reduced into possession by or on behalf of another person and possession of it has not since been lost or abandoned…

A person who picks flowers from a flowerbed or greenhouse, or apples from a garden tree commits the *actus reus* of theft, since apples and flowers are property. Subsection 4(3) applies to their 'wild' counterparts. It affirms that wild flowers, or fruit or foliage from wild trees or plants on other people's land, do not count as property capable of being stolen unless it is done for some kind of commercial purpose. A person who picks wild blackberries or apples, plants or mushrooms and sells them to a restaurant or shop, or processes them for onward trade, is covered by s.4 and commits theft, assuming all the other elements (e.g. dishonesty) of theft are present.

#### **12.1.2 Identifying the property**

A key task in deciding whether theft of property has occurred is to identify the property. Misidentifying the property means the charge will fail, even though a theft has been committed.

##### **Activity 12.2**

**Read Wilson, Section 14.2.A.2(b) 'Things in action and other intangible property' and state what, if anything, has been stolen in the following questions.**

- **a. A draws forged cheques owned by B for the sum of £1,000 on B's bank account and pays them into his account, causing a transfer of funds (a variation of what happened in** *Chan Man-Sin* **v** *A-G for Hong Kong* **[1988] 1 WLR 196).**
- **b. A eats a meal in a restaurant, although he has no money, and leaves without paying the bill, which is £20.**

**page 167**
##### **Bodies and body parts**

One cannot steal bodies or body parts because bodies are not personal property. In *Sharpe* (1857) 169 ER 959, D dug up a corpse and sold it to a surgeon for dissection. D was charged with and convicted of theft, but his conviction was quashed. As it was said in this case, 'a body wants no owner'. The same rule applies to body parts.

##### **Illustration 12.1**

**A cuts a lock of B's hair because B is a pop star and she wants a keepsake.**

A has not committed theft of the hair. This is an offence against the person (battery), not against property. A similar conclusion follows if the hair is on the floor of the hairdressers, except here there is no criminal offence at all. There are some qualifications to this to cover cases such as mummies and corpses for dissection which take on the properties of property rather than being simply a corpse. Authority for this is *Kelly* [1999] QB 621, in which a Royal College of Surgeons' technician gave body parts to D, who was an artist. These included human heads, arms, legs and torsos. D made casts of the body parts which were exhibited in an art gallery. Both D and the technician were convicted of theft, but in their appeal they contended the body parts did not constitute property. The appeal was dismissed. A corpse, or part of a corpse, is capable of being property within s.4 of the Theft Act 1968 if it has acquired different attributes by virtue of the application of skill, such as dissection or preservation techniques, for exhibition or teaching purposes.

Using the same reasoning, in *Welsh* [1974] RTR 478, a driver was guilty of theft for removing his own urine specimen from a police station. He did this to avoid a conviction for driving with excess alcohol.

##### **Activity 12.3**

**Read Wilson, Section 14.2.A.2 'Property: general definition', Section (a) 'Human body parts' and answer the following question.**

**A, a hairdresser, collects his client's hair with which to make cushions. He keeps the hair in a refuse bag pending stuffing the cushions. B, a rival cushion stuffer, takes the hair, having put it in her own bag. What, if anything, has B stolen?**

**No feedback provided.**

#### **12.1.3 Appropriation**

Prior to the Theft Act 1968 the essence of theft, or larceny as it was known, was the taking and carrying away of personal property. (One of the key differences between larceny and theft introduced by the Theft Act is that there is no longer any need for a taking and carrying away of the property. It is not needed but is sufficient.) Appropriation is defined by s.3(1) of the Theft Act 1968 as:

Any assumption by a person of the rights of an owner amounts to an appropriation, and this includes, where he has come by the property (innocently or not) without stealing it, any later assumption of a right to it by keeping or dealing with it as owner.

This statement emphasises that it is not necessary to physically take property to appropriate it. Indeed, as the provision makes clear, one can even appropriate property which is lawfully in one's possession. A person who finds property, or borrows it, is not committing theft. However, if they subsequently assume rights of ownership over the property – for example by selling it, lending it to someone else, or deciding to keep it – this amounts to an appropriation of the property. In deciding whether the defendant has appropriated the relevant property, the first question to be asked therefore is what the rights of an owner comprise. The second question is whether the defendant has assumed one of those rights and, if so, which one. If the defendant exercises any of these rights over property belonging to someone else, he appropriates that property.

In *Pitham and Hehl* (1977) 65 Cr App R 45, the defendant invited two people into his friend's house while his friend was in prison and offered to sell them his friend's furniture. The Court of Appeal held that this offer constituted an appropriation as it was

**page 168**
an assumption of one of the rights of ownership, namely the right to sell. Compare the recent case of *R* v *Darroux* [2018] EWCA Crim 1009. The defendant filled out claim forms for overtime and expenses, which she gave to her employers. The claims were grossly inflated. She was charged with theft of the moneys transferred to her account via bank transfer. In order to gain a conviction, the prosecution had to show that the money coming into her account came there as a result of her assuming a right of ownership over it. Had she? What had she done? What she had done was to fill out some claim forms, which was a long way from doing anything in regard to the money. Yes, she had caused the transfer but, no, she did not cause it by way of appropriation. She did it by way of writing a false claim form. The Court of Appeal quashed her conviction.

##### **Activity 12.4**

**Read Wilson, Section 14.2.A '***Actus reus***'. List as many rights of ownership as you can think of and consider how each of these rights could be appropriated. Then consider the following questions.**

- **a. What rights of ownership did the defendant in** *Morris* **(1983) appropriate? How did he do so?**
- **b. If A takes the key of a car so that he can steal the car later, has he appropriated only the key or also the car?**
- **c. Would Mrs Darroux have appropriated the money transferred into her account if she had drawn a cheque on it?**

##### **Consent and appropriation**

Is it a necessary ingredient in an appropriation that the act be unauthorised? In *Lawrence* [1972] AC 626 the House of Lords said no. An Italian student took a lift in a taxi. At the end of the trip, as he did not speak good English, he held out his wallet for the taxi driver to take the right fare. The taxi driver took far more than the correct fare and was charged and convicted of theft of the money. He appealed on the basis that the trial judge should have told the jury that there could be no appropriation if the owner consented. The House of Lords upheld the conviction, stating that the statutory definition of appropriation did not include the words 'without the owner's consent'. So even if the student had truly consented to the taking of the money it had still been appropriated by the taxi driver.

The House of Lords came to a different conclusion in *Morris* [1984] AC 320. The defendant had swapped price tags on a tin of beans in a supermarket in order to purchase the beans at a lower price. He was arrested by a store detective before reaching the checkout and charged with theft of the can. Upholding the conviction, the House of Lords concluded that it was of the essence of an appropriation that the act be by way of 'adverse interference or usurpation of the owner's rights'. Contrary to *Lawrence* (where taking the money from the wallet was an appropriation despite the owner's authority), their Lordships concluded that taking the goods off the shelf was not an appropriation because self-service shops authorise this act. It was only when the price labels were swapped that an appropriation occurred, because this was not authorised and was adverse to the owner's right. Similar decisions were reached in *Meech* [1974] QB 549 and a number of other cases including *Fritschy* [1985] Crim LR 745.

Fritschy (F) was a dealer in gold coins (krugerrands) for a Dutch company. F was asked by V to collect a consignment of such coins from England for onward delivery to H's bank in Switzerland. F took them to Switzerland but did not deliver them to H's bank, instead keeping them for his own purposes. The question for the court (which does not concern us) was where the appropriation had taken place. On the authority of *Lawrence* it had taken place in England. The Court of Appeal, preferring the House of Lords decision in *Morris* to that in *Lawrence*, decided that it had taken place in Switzerland. There had been no appropriation in England because D had taken possession of the krugerrands with H's consent and, until he had deviated from V's instructions and authority (in Switzerland), had not appropriated V's property.

**page 169**
The conflict of approach between *Lawrence* and *Morris* was finally resolved in *Gomez*  [1993] AC 442. D, the assistant manager of a shop, agreed with his accomplice, R (a customer), to help him acquire goods in exchange for two stolen cheques. Knowing that the cheques were stolen, D deceived the shop manager into authorising the sale of the goods to the customer in exchange for the cheques. D was charged with theft contrary to s.1(1) of the Theft Act 1968 and was convicted at first instance. He appealed, submitting that the goods had been sold under a contract between the customer and the shop, and that there could be no appropriation of property belonging to another where the act relied upon was a contract of sale passing ownership to the customer. The Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) agreed and allowed D's appeal against conviction. On appeal by the Crown, the House of Lords held that the fact that the act was authorised in no way prevented it from being an appropriation. It was not of the essence of an appropriation that it constituted some form of **challenge to, or interference with, the owner's rights.** 

##### **Activity 12.5**

**Note that in** *Gomez* **it was D, not R, who was charged with theft. What had D done to appropriate the property?**

In *Gomez*, the transfer was defective because the shop manager's consent was obtained by fraud and so the transfer of ownership could be undone. Does the person who induces the transfer also appropriate property where there has been no fraud and where the transferee receives an absolute title to the property?

This was the question the House of Lords had to answer in *Hinks* [2001] 2 AC 241. In this case D had befriended V, a naive and gullible man, and encouraged him to make her gifts of money from his bank account. She was convicted of theft, although there was no evidence of duress or deception, or that V had parted with the money otherwise than by gift. The defence case was that the recipient of a valid gift could not be guilty of theft. Either there is a valid transfer of title or there is an appropriation. There cannot be both. Lord Steyn said that whether or not V had gifted the money, D, by acquiring title, had appropriated it. The acquisition of title, on this view, is simply the clearest possible case of 'assuming rights of ownership'. This was a surprising decision because the transfer was treated as valid by the civil law – V could not claim the money back in the civil courts as it was a perfect gift – but it was an invalid transfer by the criminal law. D was guilty of stealing the money, assuming her obtaining of the money was thought to be dishonest. The same principle applies to other transactions involving the transfer of ownership such as contracts for sale (*Gomez*).

##### **Activity 12.6**

**The House of Lords made it clear that most people who received property by way of gift would not be guilty of theft. Liability in such a case will depend upon whether D was dishonest in receiving the gift. Most receivers of gifts are not – thank goodness! Now read Wilson, Section 14.2.B.2 'Dishonesty' and decide whether Mrs Hinks was dishonest in receiving her gift and how the court approached the question of dishonesty. Once you have done that you might wish to read the dissenting opinion of Lord Hobhouse who, however immoral you think Mrs Hinks was, is surely right in concluding that she was not. You will find** *Hinks* **in the Online Library.**

**Belonging to another**

A person cannot be guilty of theft if the property they appropriate does not belong to another person. But a person can be guilty of theft if they appropriate property that belongs to them! How can this be? The answer to this question is to be found in s.5 of the Theft Act 1968 which defines the term 'belonging to another'. Section 5(1) states that property belongs to 'any person having possession or control of it, or having in it any proprietary right or interest'.

**page 170**
The consequence of this rather puzzling subsection is that a person can commit theft of their own property so long as it also belongs to someone else for the purpose of s.5. To understand this section properly let us assume that the property is a racehorse, which is owned by a Mr Southwell. For the purpose of the Theft Act 1968 the racehorse belongs to:

-  Mr Southwell
-  Mrs Goodwood, part owner
-  Ms Lingfield, the owner of the stables where the racehorse is stabled
-  Mr Aintree, the jockey, when he takes the horse for a gallop (during the gallop)
-  Mr Doncaster, the blacksmith, to whom the horse is delivered for a few hours to be shod (during those hours)
-  Mrs Wincanton, the owner's friend, to whom he lends the horse to compete in a race (during the loan period)
-  The Happy Valley Finance Company, who lends Mr Southwell £50,000, using the horse as security.

If any of these people appropriate the racehorse from any one of the others, they have appropriated 'property belonging to another'. The racehorse belongs to Mr Southwell, Mrs Goodwood and the Happy Valley Finance Company since each has 'proprietary rights or interests in the horse'. It belongs to the other parties by virtue of their possession or control during the time they are in possession or have control. This does not of course mean that they are necessarily guilty of theft because of the need to establish all the elements of the offence, in particular, of course, dishonesty. If Mr Southwell took back the horse from Mrs Wincanton without formally terminating the bailment he would have appropriated property belonging to another, but he would not usually be guilty of theft since his taking would not be dishonest and, moreover, Mrs Wincanton would have no right as against him to retain the horse and so he could terminate the bailment perfectly legitimately simply by taking the horse. In *Meredith*  [1973] Crim LR 253, the defendant took his own car from a police car park where it had been impounded. He was indicted for theft. The trial judge directed the jury to acquit on the ground that the police, although having the possession and control of the car for the purpose of s.5(1), had no right to retain the car as against him.

##### **Activity 12.7**

**Read Wilson, Section 14.2.A.3 '"Belonging to another": who does property belong to?' and compare** *Meredith* **with** *Turner* **[1971] 1 WLR 901 CA, which is a good illustration of how a true owner can steal from a mere possessor. Why was Meredith acquitted and Turner convicted? Are they both right? Make sure you make notes of both cases and your conclusions.**

**Abandoned property**

If property is abandoned it may belong to no one, in which case it cannot be stolen. However, even abandoned property may belong to someone else, for example the owner of the land or vessel in which the property is found.

In *Hibbert* v *McKiernan* [1948] 2 KB 142, D was a trespasser on land owned by a golf club who collected golf balls lost and abandoned by their owners. He was charged with theft. D argued that, having been abandoned, the balls belonged to no one: the King's Bench Divisional Court disagreed. Although the balls no longer belonged to their previous owners they did belong to the club. Since D was a trespasser, the golf club had the right to exclude him from the course and, therefore, from the balls. To that extent the club had control of the balls and so they belonged to the club for the purpose of s.5. Note that this means that other golfers would not be committing theft of balls which **they** found on the course. These balls, having been abandoned, would belong to no one **as against them**. It is for this reason also that I am not guilty of theft when, every Saturday, I collect a dozen or so golf balls from my garden which some unfortunate golfer has hit there from the golf course abutting my property. The golf balls belong to me. I do not own them but, for the purposes of s.5, I am the only person who cannot steal them.

**page 171**
*Williams* v *Phillips* (1957) 41 Cr App R 5 is a comparable case. A householder put refuse out for collection by the local authority refuse workers. It was held by the Divisional Court that such refuse remained property belonging to the householder until collected, whereupon property passed to the local authority. So refuse workers helping themselves to such property could be convicted of theft, on the basis that the property had always belonged to someone (see also *Woodman* [1974] QB 754 and *Hancock* [1990] Crim LR 125).

##### **Activity 12.8**

**See Wilson, Section 14.2.A.3(b) 'Theft by owners'. If A, a householder, hires a building skip into which to throw her doors and windows, which she is replacing, does B appropriate 'property belonging to another' if he takes them? In order to answer this question you must consider whether there is any difference between this case and that of** *Williams* **v** *Phillips***.**

**The property must belong to another at the time of appropriation**

In *Chodorek* v *Poland* [2017] ACD 244 (82) QBD the Administrative Court confirmed that a person who uses a debit card at an ATM to withdraw cash commits theft if he has no overdraft facility and knows he does not have the funds to cover the amount withdrawn. All the elements of the offence are present, namely a dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. The property appropriated in this case is money (i.e. personal property), not a thing in action. And, at the time of the appropriation, the money belonged to the issuing bank and not to him as he was not in credit.

*Corcoran* v *Whent* [1977] Crim LR 52 is a perfect, if rare, example of how a theft conviction was not possible because the property appropriated no longer belonged to another person at the time of appropriation. D ate food in a restaurant with a friend. When he left the restaurant, his friend told him that the meal had not been paid for. D did not go back to pay for the meal although his intentions on entering the restaurant were perfectly honest. He was later arrested, charged and convicted of theft. D's conviction was quashed on the ground that although all the elements of theft were present, they did not coincide. At the time the appropriation (eating) of the property (food) belonging to another (restaurant) occurred he had no *mens rea* for theft. At the time the *mens rea* was formed he did not appropriate property belonging to another for three simple reasons: (i) one cannot assume rights of ownership over the contents of one's stomach, (ii) the food was no longer food (property) it was mush in his stomach and (iii) it belonged to no one, not even him!

**Subsection 5(3) of the Theft Act 1968**

This is a deceptively difficult subsection designed to cover the case of someone who has passed ownership and possession in property to someone else for a particular purpose and that purpose is disregarded. Is the transferee guilty of theft? The subsection reads:

Where a person receives property from or on account of another, and is under an obligation to the other to retain and deal with that property or its proceeds in a particular way, the property or proceeds shall be regarded (as against him) as belonging to the other.

This subsection has the effect that if A gives property (e.g. money) to B to do something specific with it (e.g. pay a bill, deliver to charity), B commits theft if they do something else with it **even if B has become the sole legal owner** of the property.

The major problem arises in deciding whether an obligation has arisen to deal with the transferred property in a particular way. By 'obligation' is meant legal obligation. Easy cases involve money which is explicitly earmarked by the transferor for a particular purpose.

**page 172**
##### **Illustration 12.2**

**Chen is collecting for the charity, Prisoner's Aid, outside a train station. Nico puts £5 into Chen's collection box. Chen later takes out the £5 and buys a spicy chicken burger with it.**

As far as the civil law and s.5(1) are concerned, the £5 belongs only to Chen. It no longer belongs to Nico, nor does it yet belong to the charity. Section 5(3), however, deems the money still to belong to the donor, although technically they have transferred possession and all rights and ownership over the money to the donee. This is because charity collectors owe an obligation to the donors to hand over their donations to the relevant charity. So Chen is guilty of theft. This is exactly what happened and was decided in *Wain* [1995] 2 Cr App R 660.

In *Davidge* v *Bunnett* [1984] Crim LR 297, the defendant shared a flat with others who gave her cheques to pay their joint gas bill. It was understood that D would have to pay the cheques into her own bank account before doing so. In fact, D spent the proceeds on Christmas presents. The Divisional Court held that s.5(3) applied, that D was under a legal obligation to use the proceeds to pay the bill and therefore they were property belonging to another by virtue of s.5(3).

Compare this case with *DPP* v *Huskinson* (1988) 152 JP 582, where it was held not to be theft to use housing benefit for purposes other than paying the recipient's rent. The point of the relevant legislation was to impose a duty upon the social services to pay benefit to the recipient. It was not the point of the legislation to impose an obligation on the recipient to apply it directly for that purpose. In short, the housing benefit was his own to deal with as he saw fit.

##### **Activity 12.9**

**Read Wilson, Section 14.2.A.3 '"Belonging to another": who does property belong to?', Section (c) 'Special cases of belonging' and answer the following questions, making sure you take notes.**

- **a. Why was the travel agent in** *Hall* **(1972) not guilty of theft? Did he not have an obligation to secure flights for the depositors?**
- **b. Who decides whether D has an obligation to deal with the property in a particular way and what is taken into account in deciding this?**

**Subsection 5(4) of the Theft Act 1968**

Subsection 5(4) was designed to address problems such as occurred in *Moynes* v *Cooper* [1956] 1 QB 439, in which an employer paid an employee's salary twice into the employee's bank account by mistake and the employee spent it. Under the civil law, the funds in the account (thing in action) belong to the account holder. Subsection 5(4) confirms that the property mistakenly transferred or otherwise received belongs also to the transferor for the purpose of the law of theft, so that if the transferee treats the property as their own they will be guilty of theft. It reads as:

Where a person gets property by another's mistake, and is under an obligation to make restoration (in whole or in part) of the property or its proceeds or of the value thereof, then to the extent of that obligation the property or proceeds shall be regarded (as against him) as belonging to the person entitled to restoration, and an intention not to make restoration shall be regarded accordingly as an intention to deprive that person of the property or proceeds.

It has been made clear in a number of cases that reliance on s.5(4) is not strictly necessary to denote the relevant property as belonging to another. In *Shadrokh-Cigari* [1988] Crim LR 465, a bank account was wrongly credited with approximately £286,000 rather than the £286 owing. D took and spent the money. He was convicted of theft of the money on the basis that it remained property belonging to another, namely the issuing bank.

**page 173**
##### **Activity 12.10**

**Read Wilson, Section 14.2.A.3(c) 'Special cases of belonging' and explain the basis upon which the Court of Appeal upheld the appeal in** *Shadrokh-Cigari***. Is s.5(4) completely redundant following this case?**

#### **12.1.4** *Mens rea***: theft**

##### **Dishonesty**

The dishonesty requirement reflects the general principle that criminalisation is inappropriate if the defendant has not acted in a socially unacceptable or immoral fashion (see Section 1.2 of this module guide). Whether or not an appropriation of a person's property is socially acceptable or not depends to a certain extent on why it was done. If the property was a gun, for example, and it was done to prevent the owner killing with it, it might be considered morally incoherent to convict the appropriator of theft. This would mean that the defendant would be expected to prioritise a property interest above a personal interest. Why would they? Why should they?

Dishonesty is not defined in the Theft Act 1968. However, s.2 of the Act tells us what dishonesty is **not**. Section 2(1) states that certain beliefs of the defendant are inconsistent with having a dishonest state of mind. These are:

- a. a belief that he has in law the right to deprive the other of it, on behalf of himself or of a third person; or
- b. a belief that he would have the other's consent if the other knew of the appropriation and the circumstances of it; or
- c. a belief that the person to whom the property belongs cannot be discovered by taking reasonable steps.

The gun example above is a possible illustration of where s.2(1)(a) might apply. So also is the case where D takes a sum of money from V believing they have the right to it because V owes them that same sum (compare *Robinson* (1977) Crim LR 173). So also is *Hinks*, although the court at first instance obviously thought otherwise. An example of s.2(1)(b) is where D takes V's milk from the refrigerator of their jointly occupied flat for a cup of tea, having used all their own milk. An example of s.2(1)(c) is where D finds a sum of money in a public area which, because of its relatively small size, they conclude will never be reported to the police. The key point here is not that D does have this right (s.2(1)(a)), or does have V's consent (s.2(1)(b)), or that the property cannot be returned to the owner by taking reasonable steps (s.2(1)(c)), **but that D has this belief**. The jury will decide this by reference to all the evidence.

It was once thought that if D did not have one of the beliefs in s.2 then they were automatically dishonest as a matter of law. This view was rejected in a number of cases in the early years following the passing of the Act. The reason for this was explained by Lawton LJ in *Feely* [1973] 1 QB 530. He said that immorality was of the essence of stealing and the mere fact that a person takes property when he knows he has no right or the owner would not consent does not render the taking immoral.

The facts of the case help us understand this point. D was a cashier in a betting office who, contrary to his firm's instructions, took some money out of the till on a Friday, intending to repay it on the Monday. He left a note to this effect in the till. D was charged with theft. The trial judge held that D's actions were clearly dishonest. Section 2 did not apply and his intention to replace the money was irrelevant. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal. Lawton LJ said that whether or not a person is dishonest was not a matter for the judge but was a question of fact which should have been left to the jury. He said:

Jurors, when deciding whether an appropriation was dishonest can be reasonably expected to, and should, apply the current standards of ordinary decent people. In their own lives they have to decide what is and what is not dishonest. We can see no reason why, when in a jury box, they should require the help of a judge to tell them what amounts to dishonesty.

**page 174**
A different direction for dishonesty – which is slightly more beneficial to the defence – was laid down in *Ghosh* [1982] QB 1053, a case on fraud, which carries the same dishonesty requirement. The defendant was a consultant at a hospital. He falsely claimed fees in respect of an operation that he had not carried out. D claimed that he thought he was not dishonest since he was owed the same amount of money for consultation fees. The judge directed the jury members, in accordance with *Feely*, that they must simply apply their own standards as ordinary decent people. D was convicted and his appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. Lord Lane CJ stated that the jury must consider if the conduct of the accused was dishonest according to the 'ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people' (if not, then the prosecution fails). If it is dishonest according to those standards then the jury must consider whether the accused 'must have realised that what he was doing was by those standards dishonest'.

The significant aspect of this direction is that it permits an acquittal in cases where the defendant is dishonest according to prevailing social standards but does not realise this. Critics describe the test as a Robin Hood defence.

##### **Activity 12.11**

**Read Wilson, Section 14.2.B.2 'Dishonesty' and answer the following question. Why is the** *Ghosh* **test described as a Robin Hood defence?**

*Ivey* **v** *Genting Casinos* **[2017] UKSC 67**

The *Ghosh* test was abandoned by the Supreme Court in a case decided under the Gambling Act 2005. The question for the Court was whether Mr Ivey, a professional gambler, was acting dishonestly, that he was cheating, in gambling with cards, which although provided by the casino, he was able to identify by virtue of a defective pattern on the cards' reverse side. He argued that he was not dishonest because, whatever the general public might feel about the honesty of his actions, as a professional gambler he considered what he did to be simply good gambling and assumed the public would think likewise. The Supreme Court rejected this argument. In so doing, it found that the second limb was defective in that it introduced an unnecessary and problematic subjective element into the assessment of dishonesty. Whether someone is dishonest or not does not vary with the defendant's own assessment of what counts as dishonesty but is decided according to objective standards of ordinary, reasonable people. In future, only the first question is to be considered, that is whether, according to the standards of reasonable and honest people, what was done was dishonest. This returns the law to the position in *Feely* [1973] 1 All ER 341 and will become the standard test for dishonesty in theft, fraud and other offences in which dishonesty is an element.

The procedure in relation to directing the jury on dishonesty is first of all to ask it to consider whether s.2 is applicable. If it is, that is an end to the matter and D is acquitted. If it is not, the jury must then consider whether the defendant is dishonest according to the *Ivey/Feely* test, that is according to the standards of ordinary people as represented by the jury.

A five-strong Court of Appeal in *R* v *Barton and Booth* [2020] EWCA Crim 575 has confirmed that the *obiter* comments as to the test for dishonesty – set out in the judgment of Lord Hughes in *Ivey* v *Genting Casinos* [2017] UKSC 67 – constitute the law to be applied when an issue arises as to alleged dishonesty. First, what was the defendant's actual state of knowledge or belief as to the facts and, secondly, was his conduct dishonest by the standards of ordinary decent people? The subjective question of whether a defendant appreciated that his behaviour was dishonest by those standards no longer applies.

**Intention permanently to deprive**

A defendant commits theft only if it is their intention for the victim never to recover the property. If D intends only to borrow property this cannot be theft, however dishonest the taking is. The key point here is that this is a *mens rea* rather than an *actus reus* element. Theft does not require the victim **to be** permanently deprived of their property. It simply requires D to have this **intention** at the precise moment they appropriate the property. Intention includes conditional intention; that is, the intention of someone who appropriates property – say a holdall – conditionally on the contents proving sufficiently valuable to take permanently. To gain a conviction, however, it is necessary for the prosecution to draft the charge so as not to refer to any specific property (compare *Easom* [1971] 2 QB 315), for example by charging D with theft of 'articles unknown, the contents of a holdall belonging to X' (see also *A-G's Reference (Nos 1 and 2 of 1979)* [1979] 3 All ER 143).

In the case of fungibles such as money, food, drink and so on, this intention exists even if D intends to return an identical sum, amount of food, drink and so on. This was made clear in *Velumyl* [1989] Crim LR 299, in which D had taken money from his employer's safe and claimed that he intended to pay it back after the weekend. The Court of Appeal held that D had not intended to return the exact coins and notes, and that therefore he was properly convicted of theft on proof of dishonesty. (**Note**: in such cases it would be far better for D to contend that he was not dishonest, given his intention to replace the money with an equivalent fund.)

Subsections 6(1) and 6(2) of the Theft Act 1968 provide two special circumstances beyond its normal meaning where the intention to take something temporarily counts as an intention permanently to deprive the owner of the property.

 **Subsection 6(1) of the Theft Act 1968**

A person is to be treated as having an intention to permanently deprive the owner of his property if his intention is to:

treat the thing as his own to dispose of regardless of the other's rights; and a borrowing or lending of it may amount to so treating it if, but only if, the borrowing or lending is for a period and in circumstances making it equivalent to an outright taking or disposal.

This provision refers to cases where the appropriation **amounts to an outright disposal** but the defendant nevertheless shows no particular commitment to depriving V of the property permanently (*Coffey* [1987] Crim LR 498). An obvious example is where D appropriates V's property, for example his dog or his painting, intending to ransom the property back to V upon payment of a sum of money. Another example is where D intends to exhaust the value of the property before returning it. So if D 'borrows' V's ticket for the Manchester United game against Manchester City intending to return it after the game, D has – by virtue of s.6(1) – the intention to permanently deprive V of her property because D is treating the ticket as his own to dispose of regardless of the other's rights.

**page 176**
In *Marshall, Coombes & Eren* [1998] 2 Cr App R 282, the Court of Appeal ruled that selling on a used but unexpired tube ticket counts, by virtue of s.6(1), as involving an intention permanently to deprive London Underground of the ticket – even though the ticket will eventually find its way back to London Underground – since the seller is treating the thing as their own to dispose of (through sale) regardless of the other's rights. In *DPP* v *Lavender* [1994] Crim LR 297, the defendant removed some doors from a council property that was due for demolition and then installed the doors in his girlfriend's flat which was also owned by the council. D was charged with theft of the doors. It was held that he did have the intention to permanently deprive under s.6(1) as, by installing the doors at another's house, D was treating the doors as if they were his own to dispose of regardless of the owner's rights.

This provision has generally been interpreted rather restrictively. It does not cover, for example, the case of a person who 'borrows', without the owner's consent, a very valuable piece of jewellery, intending to return it at the end of their year-long holiday. The courts have insisted that the defendant's intention must be to exhaust the property's usefulness, or sell or otherwise get rid of it – for example by leaving it in a remote or private location (*Lavender*). In *Lloyd* [1985] QB 829, D worked as a projectionist at a cinema who allowed B to take the films to make pirate copies and then return them. The Court of Appeal quashed D and B's convictions on the ground that they lacked the intention permanently to deprive the owner of the films, not having sought to dispose of the films, and that s.6(1) did not cover the case of borrowing for a dishonest purpose, however damaging to the owner's rights this may be.

##### **Activity 12.15**

**Read Wilson, Section 14.2.B.1 'Intention to deprive the owner permanently of his property' and answer the following question.**

**Jack Bilko, a golf professional, discovers that he has forgotten his golf balls when he arrives at the first tee of the Masters Tournament at Augusta. While his playing partner, Duke Lonard, is not looking, Jack takes a box of balls from Duke's golf bag which he uses throughout the course of the round. At the end of the match he replaces all the balls in Duke's bag. At the beginning of the next round Duke discovers the box of balls and, concluding their condition is not good enough to play with, opens another box of balls. If Jack were prosecuted for theft, would the prosecution be able to rely on s.6(1)?**

 **Subsection 6(2) of the Theft Act 1968**

By subs.6(2), A is deemed to have the intention to permanently deprive B of B's property if A parts with property in A's possession or control under a condition, which A may not be able to perform. This is intended to cover the kind of case where someone who has property belonging to someone else in their possession or control pawns that property to another.

**page 177**
### **12.2 Burglary**

Section 9 of the Theft Act 1968 creates two separate offences of burglary: an inchoate crime of ulterior intent where there is no need to prove the commission of the substantive offence (s.9(1)(a)); and a complete crime where proof of the commission of an offence is of the essence (s.9(1)(b)). Section 9(1) provides:

A person is guilty of burglary if –

- (a) he enters any building or part of a building as a trespasser and with intent to commit any such offence as is mentioned in subsection (2) below; or
- (b) having entered any building or part of it as a trespasser he steals or attempts to steal anything in the building or that part of it or inflicts or attempts to inflict on any person therein any grievous bodily harm.

Since both s.9(1)(a) and s.9(1)(b) have 'entry of a building as a trespasser' as common features for burglary these will be dealt with first before we cover the specifics of the two offences.

#### **12.2.1 Common features**

In order to be guilty of burglary, D must enter a building or part of a building as a trespasser. The following questions must be asked, therefore, in connection with both forms of the offence.

- u Was there an entry? If yes,
- u did the person entering enter as a trespasser? If yes,
- u was the entry to a building or part of a building?

##### **What counts as entry?**

To enter premises, entry of the whole person is not necessary; however, the entry must be 'effective'. This does not necessarily mean that the entry has to be capable of enabling the commission of an offence, but this helps. It is a question of fact for the jury. In *Brown* [1985] Crim LR 212, it was confirmed that, contrary to the earlier authority of *Collins* [1973] QB 100, the entry need not be substantial. So D's conviction for burglary was upheld on the basis of him having smashed the window of a shop and having leant in, feet still on the pavement, to take goods from inside the window. In *Ryan* [1996] Crim LR 320, on comparable facts the conviction was upheld although D, who had become stuck in the window, had not managed to penetrate sufficiently far into the premises to steal anything.

##### **Did the person entering enter as a trespasser?**

Entry will be as a trespasser if the entry is made without the consent, express or implied, of the occupier, and without statutory authority. The question of whether the defendant had entered as a trespasser was of key concern in *Collins*. The defendant, intending to rape V, climbed naked up a ladder and perched on her windowsill. V mistook him in the dark for her boyfriend and welcomed him in. It was not clear how far into the room D was when he received his invitation, but the jury found that his entry was sufficient for a conviction. However, the court made clear that if he was still on the windowsill when invited in, he would not have entered as a trespasser and so could not be guilty of burglary.

**page 178**
Since *Collins* it has also been decided that those who enter premises in excess of authority are trespassers on those premises. This covers those who may have permission to be in the property but exceed the permission by doing something which they were not invited to do. So in *Jones and Smith* [1976] 1 WLR 672 it was burglary for a son to enter his parent's house intending to steal a TV. Although he had general authority to enter the premises, that authority was vitiated by entering in excess of the presumed terms of his parent's consent.

##### **Activity 12.16**

**Read Wilson, Section 16.4.B 'Entry as a trespasser' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. Raffles enters Wizzo supermarket intending to buy a razor. As he has little money he decides, before entering, that if the razor costs more than the £3 in his pocket, he will steal the razor. Has Raffles committed burglary?**
- **b. In the light of** *Jones and Smith* **would Collins now be deemed to have entered as a trespasser, assuming the invitation to enter was issued prior to his having entered the bedroom?**

**Was the entry to a building or part of a building?**

A building is not defined in the Theft Act 1968, although s.9(4) states that it includes 'a vehicle or vessel constructed or adapted for human habitation' – for example houseboats, canal barges and caravans. A consensus holds that a building must be some form of structure with a degree of permanence capable of being entered. This would cover barns, churches, shops, warehouses and even portable cabins such as freezer containers, and outbuildings – but probably not tents (*B and S* v *Leathley* [1979] Crim LR 314).

A person who enters a building lawfully may become a trespasser in relation to a part of that building where they have no licence to go. Parts of buildings include living rooms, service rooms, bathrooms and roofs. In the case of *Walkington* [1979] 1 WLR 1169, it was held that a person lawfully visiting a department store was guilty of burglary when she went behind a shop counter to steal from the till. This area, being clearly defined, was 'part of a building' and she, having no authority to be there, entered as a trespasser.

#### **12.2.2** *Mens rea***: burglary**

For both offences of burglary, the defendant must know they are a trespasser or be reckless as to whether they are trespassing at the time of entry. They must also have the relevant *mens rea* for the crime they commit or intend to commit, for example, dishonesty and the intention to permanently deprive in the case of theft.

##### **Activity 12.17**

**Did Collins have the** *mens rea* **for burglary upon entering the room? No feedback provided.**

**Specific offences**

**(i) Section 9(1)(a) burglary**

The **s.9(1)(a) offence** requires intention to commit one of the ulterior offences. It will be charged when there is evidence that D had entered with the relevant intent, but had not yet consummated the proposed crime. In everyday language, a person can be a burglar without actually stealing anything or causing any harm. The most common ulterior intent is the intent to steal. Following *Jones and Smith*, this has the surprising consequence that a person who enters a shop intending to steal from it commits burglary immediately upon entering the shop, because by having this intent they enter in excess of authority and therefore enter as a trespasser.

It is important to remember that it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove entry **with intent to steal**, although of course this will usually be the case. A person who enters with intent to commit any of the offences specified commits burglary. By s.9(2) these are offences of:

**page 179**

-  stealing anything in the building or part of the building in question, or
-  inflicting on any person therein any grievous bodily harm, or
-  doing unlawful damage to the building or anything therein.

It is not burglary, therefore, to enter premises as a trespasser with intent to commit fraud, rape or cause actual bodily harm.

**(ii) Section 9(1)(b) burglary**

The **s.9(1)(b) offence** does not require proof of an ulterior intent at the time of entering as a trespasser. It is charged only where there is evidence that the substantive offence has been committed. Since the offence has been committed, proof of the ulterior intent upon entering as a trespasser is unnecessary. This form of burglary is more restricted in its coverage than s.9(1)(a). It is committed where, having entered as a trespasser, the entrant:

- u steals or attempts to steal, or
- u inflicts or attempts to inflict grievous bodily harm.

It does not cover, therefore, the case of a person who enters premises as a trespasser and then causes criminal damage to the premises or inflicts bodily harm less than grievous bodily harm. In such a case the prosecution must charge the substantive offence. For the s.9(1)(b) offence the prosecution must prove not only the entry as trespasser but also all of the elements of the ulterior offence.

##### **Activity 12.18**

**Read Wilson, Section 16.5 'Modes of committing burglary' and then answer the following questions.**

- **a. A enters a private office at her local bank, without authority, to recover the handbag she had mistakenly left there earlier in the day. Are either forms of burglary committed?**
- **b. A enters her flatmate's room to borrow, without permission, her evening dress. Are either forms of burglary committed?**
- **c. Do you think s.9(1)(b) burglary should include cases where D commits criminal damage or a non-serious offence against the person? Why do you think these crimes are not included?**

**(iii) Aggravated burglary under s.10 of the Theft Act 1968**

Under s.10(1):

- (1) A person is guilty of aggravated burglary if he commits any burglary and at the time has with him any firearm or imitation firearm, any weapon of offence, or any explosive; and for this purpose –
  - (a) 'firearm' includes an airgun or air pistol, and 'imitation firearm' means anything which has the appearance of being a firearm, whether capable of being discharged or not; and
  - (b) 'weapon of offence' means any article made or adapted for use for causing injury to or incapacitating a person, or intended by the person having it with him for such use; and
  - (c) 'explosive' means any article manufactured for the purpose of producing a practical effect by explosion, or intended by the person having it with him for that purpose.

The mere fact that the defendant has with them at the time of the burglary an object that could be used as a weapon of offence such as a crowbar or knife does not mean the offence is committed. The prosecution must either show that the article's primary purpose is for causing injury such as a gun or hunting knife or has been adapted for such use or, in the case of articles such as crowbars, knives, etc. that it was **intended for such use by the defendant**. See *R* v *Eletu and White* [2018] EWCA Crim 599.

**page 180**
The relevant time for possessing the weapon depends on whether it is a s.9(1)(a) offence or a s.9(1)(b) offence. If (a) then possession must be at time of entry; if (b) possession must be at the time the ulterior offence is committed. In *O'Leary* (1986) 82 Cr App R 341, D entered a house without a weapon. Once inside he took a knife from the kitchen and took it upstairs to effect the burglary. D's conviction was upheld on appeal. It was held that since the offence was charged under s.9(1)(b), there was no requirement that he had the knife at the time of entry.

##### **Am I ready to move on?**

Are you ready to move on to the next part of this chapter? You are if – without referring to the module guide or Wilson – you can answer the following questions.

- 1. Explain the difference between s.9(1)(a) and s.9(1)(b) burglary.
- 2. Explain the considerations the prosecution must take into account in deciding which to charge.
- 3. List the substantive offences around which **both** forms of burglary are constituted.
- 4. Explain what 'entry as a trespasser' involves.
- 5. Explain when, if ever, a person can be guilty of burglary although they have the occupier's consent to entering the building.
- 6. Explain what 'building' and 'part of a building' mean for the purpose of burglary.
- 7. For the purpose of aggravated burglary how does the form of the burglary impact on the question of when the burglar is in possession of a weapon?

### **12.3 Fraud**

The Fraud Act 2006 abolishes all the deception offences in the Theft Acts 1968 and 1978. These included obtaining property by deception, obtaining services by deception and evading a debt by deception. The main reason for the change was that the previous offences had a high degree of overlap, were unduly technical, and did not cover some important forms of fraudulent wrongdoing. For example, communicating false information by computer as a 'phishing' ploy designed to defraud the recipient could not ground a deception offence, because all deception offences required D to have made a false representation which was believed and acted on by a specific person.

This causal effect had to be proved by the prosecution. So, also, a car seller who made false representations to a purchaser who subsequently bought the car would not be guilty of fraud unless the prosecution could prove **beyond reasonable doubt** that, but for these representations, the purchase would not have been made. This clearly makes the prosecution's job difficult, and probably too difficult.

The Fraud Act 2006 replaces the deception offence with one basic fraud offence which can be committed in three ways. These are by:

- false representation
- failure to disclose information
- abuse of position.

The main change renders the wrongdoing the intentions of the wrongdoer rather than the reactions of the victim. David Ormerod (*Smith and Hogan's criminal law* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015) [ISBN 9780198702313]) complains that, in effect, the new offence criminalises 'lying'. It is intended to capture wrongdoing such as that of computer 'phishers', who make their money out of duping the one in a million people who happen to believe them, which was not possible under the old law. The problem is that it also in theory captures many less heinous forms of behaviour which are part and parcel of everyday commercial life. Sellers are expected to tempt us with 'white lies', are they not? The maximum sentence for fraud is 10 years' imprisonment.

**page 181**
#### **12.3.1 Section 2: fraud by false representation**

The essence of this form of fraud is some form of deception. Section 2 of the Fraud Act 2006 reads as follows:

- (1) A person is in breach of this section if he
  - (a) dishonestly makes a false representation, and
  - (b) intends, by making the representation
    - (i) to make a gain for himself or another, or
    - (ii) to cause loss to another or to expose another to a risk of loss.
- (2) A representation is false if
  - (a) it is untrue or misleading, and
  - (b) the person making it knows that it is, or might be, untrue or misleading.
- (3) 'Representation' means any representation as to fact or law, including a representation as to the state of mind of –
  - (a) the person making the representation, or
  - (b) any other person.
- (4) A representation may be express or implied.
- (5) For the purposes of this section a representation may be regarded as made if it (or anything implying it) is submitted in any form to any system or device designed to receive, convey or respond to communications (with or without human intervention).

##### **Elements of the offence**

The *actus reus* requires proof that D made a false representation. The *mens rea* requires proof that D:

- knew the representation was or might be false, and
- acted intending to make a gain or cause a loss, and
- acted dishonestly.

##### *Actus reus***: fraud**

The conduct element in fraud by false representation is simple. It requires proof that D made a representation and that representation was false. There is no need to prove that V acted to their detriment in reliance on the representation. Indeed, there is no need for it to be communicated to V so long as it is made. So the phisher commits the offence as soon as they type out their false statement: the prosecution does not have to wait until the email is transmitted.

##### **Meaning of representation**

Representation is not defined in the Fraud Act 2006 except to say:

- (3) 'Representation' means any representation as to fact or law, including a representation as to the state of mind of –
  - (a) the person making the representation, or
  - (b) any other person.
- (4) A representation may be express or implied.

The simplest meaning of representation is 'stating something', 'pretending something', 'professing something' or 'creating an impression'. So a seller who tells a buyer that the car he is selling is in good condition makes a 'representation' that it is in good condition. Similarly, a buyer who tells the seller that her credit is good makes a 'representation' that her credit is good. A representation can be made without words. It can be made by conduct; for example, painting over rust damage on a car, thus giving the impression it is in better condition than it is. It can also be implied.

**Assume A wishes to buy a car on credit and wishes to influence the decision to advance her credit. The following words or actions will be express representations.**

- **a. My credit is good (representation of fact).**
- **b. I bank with Coutts and Co. (a bank used largely by the rich and powerful) (one express and one implied representation of fact – the implied representation is creating an impression that she is rich and powerful).**
- **c. I have just won £1 million on the lottery (representation of fact she is creating an impression that she is rich).**
- **d. I will pay you back next week (representation as to state of mind she is creating an impression that she intends to pay the money back).**

##### **Activity 12.19**

**Read Wilson, Section 15.1.C.1. 'Fraud by false representation', Section (a) '***Actus reus***'. Look at the following scenarios and state what representations are being made and identify which, if any, are false.**

- **a. A, a poor man, hires a Rolls Royce for the day.**
- **b. A, a car dealer, turns back the odometer reading on a car prior to selling it.**
- **c. A pays for chips in a casino with a cheque, having lost the bank's authority to use it.**

Note, for exam purposes the **most important abilities** you should be able to display in the context of fraud are:

- a. being able to identify the representation that you think is the basis of the fraud charge, and
- b. being able to explain why **in relation to that representation** it is false.

It will usually help to ask yourself 'What false impression or statement is D making for the purpose of defrauding V?'

**Can one make a representation by saying or doing nothing?**

As a general rule, the answer is no since making a representation means to state something or do something.

##### **Illustration 12.4**

**A sells B a car, the odometer of which he knows carries a false reading.**

**A cannot be guilty of fraud as he has made no false representation as to the mileage. It would be different if, upon being asked, A confirmed the reading or said that it was genuine (express representation of fact) or that he believed it to be genuine (express representation as to his state of mind).**

##### **Activity 12.20**

**Read Wilson, Section 15.1.C.1.(a) '***Actus reus***' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. A is selling her car. It is in bad condition. To ensure that B, a potential buyer, does not realise this, she tells B she will only show him the car at 9pm. B inspects the car and does not spot the defects. Is A guilty of fraud?**
- **b. Would it make any difference to the answer to the above question if A had said, untruthfully, 'You will have to come at 9pm as I do not get back from work until then'?**

In two situations silence may constitute a false representation. In both cases the silence creates a false impression.

**page 183**
 **Where there exists a duty of disclosure (also covered by s.3)**

##### **Illustration 12.5**

**Adam performs a surgical operation on Eve at Green Wing Hospital. He does not tell the hospital that Eve is a private patient and, as a result, the hospital, assuming Eve is a national health service (free) patient, does not invoice him for the cost of the operation (***Firth* **(1990) 91 Cr App R 217).**

By not telling the hospital, when he is under a duty of disclosure, Adam is creating a false impression that Eve is a national health service (NHS) patient rather than the private patient she actually is. Because of his duty of disclosure, the hospital is entitled to assume that all patients operated on are NHS patients unless Adam tells them otherwise.

Where the circumstances giving rise to a representation change so that the original representation no longer accurately describes the true state of affairs.

##### **Illustration 12.6**

- **a. Adam tells Eve truthfully that the odometer reading on the car he is selling is accurate. Prior to concluding the sale he discovers that the odometer has, in fact, been tampered with. He does not communicate this to Eve.**
- **b. Adam truthfully tells his local authority that Eve, his mother, is bedridden and so in need of a downstairs bathroom. On the strength of this representation the local authority agrees to install a new bathroom. Before starting the work Eve dies. Adam fails to tell the local authority of her death (the facts of** *Rai* **[2000] 1 Cr App R 242).**

In both cases, Adam's silence is impliedly telling the other party that nothing relevant to their agreement has changed since the first representation was made. Put another way, in both cases the statement that Adam has made which was once true is now false. The change in circumstances has made it so.

**Representations and machines**

Under the old law of the Theft Acts, it was also not possible to make representation to a machine: the essence of the deception offences was the tricking of a human mind. The Fraud Act 2006 s.2(5) now makes it possible to commit fraud via a machine, since a representation is regarded as having been made:

if it (or anything implying it) is submitted in any form to any system or device designed to receive, convey or respond to communications (with or without human intervention).

This would include putting false information on an online tax or insurance form, or computer 'phishing' as in the case of those who place viral sob stories on the internet which are intended to cause naive recipients to transfer money to the phisher. In this latter case the representation is made as soon as the representation is typed on to the phisher's machine, thus relieving the prosecution from having to prove that anyone read it.

A person who puts a foreign coin in a slot machine, such as a car park ticket machine or chocolate machine, also commits fraud, whether or not the ruse is successful, not because of subs.2(5) but because by putting the coin in they are making a representation in the usual way. 'This is a £1 coin', 'this is a \$2 coin', as the case may be. Under the old law this was not a fraud because it required a human mind to be deceived. As has been explained the fraud is now complete upon the making of a false representation. It does not have to be effective or even communicated.

##### **Activity 12.21**

**Read Wilson, Section 15.1.C.1.(a) '***Actus reus***' and answer the following question.**

**Adam, intending to sell his car, puts an advertisement on the windscreen while it is in his garage. It says that the car has been driven by one careful female owner. In fact it has been driven by him. Has Adam committed the** *actus reus* **of fraud at this stage?** 

**page 184**
**The representation must be false**

By subs.2(2) of the Fraud Act 2006, a representation is false if (a) it is untrue or misleading, and (b) the person making it knows that it is, or might be, untrue or misleading. This is a very inclusive definition. It includes the situation of someone who believes what they say to be true but knows it might not be true or knows it might be misleading. The coverage of the act is so wide it covers the kind of cases of (sharp) practice in which most tradespersons have traditionally engaged to make a living. It criminalises 'mere puffs'. If Heineken describes its lager as 'probably the best lager in the world', is it acting fraudulently when all purchasers understand that the claim is not to be taken too seriously and do not buy their lager on the strength of it?

##### **Activity 12.22**

**Read Wilson, Section 15.1.C.1 (a) '***Actus reus***' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. Adam owns a BMW in which he has driven 111,000 miles since he bought it a year ago. The odometer, having 'gone round the clock', shows 11,000 miles. It is worth £15,000 as it stands, but £30,000 if the mileage truly was 11,000. He puts a notice on his car windscreen in the following terms: 'BMW for sale. One year old. One careful owner. £30,000'. Has Adam made a false representation? If so, what is it?**
- **b. Claire is an art dealer. She describes a painting in the sales particulars as an 'early Constable'. The painting, as she knows, is painted not by John Constable, but by his son, John Charles Constable, a lesser artist. Has Claire made a false representation? If so, what is it?**
- **c. Jane is an art dealer. She describes a painting in the sales particulars as an 'early Rembrandt'. She believes it to be a Rembrandt, and indeed bought it as such, but knows that in the case of this particular painter precise attribution is difficult due to the number of workshop versions of Rembrandt's work on the market. In fact it is not a Rembrandt. Has Jane made a false representation? If so, what is it?**

**Note: Remember what was said earlier about the importance of being able to identify the representation and what is false about it. If you are having difficulty with any of these three cases you need to revisit the textbook.**

*Mens rea***: fraud**

The core *mens rea* element for fraud contrary to ss.2, 3 and 4 of the Fraud Act 2006 is the defendant's intention by making the representation, to make a gain for themself or another, or to cause loss to another or to expose another to a risk of loss. Intention in this context, in line with its meaning in theft and unlike its meaning elsewhere, means purpose or knowledge of virtual certainty. In theft, such knowledge is intention **as a matter of law**, rather than as a matter of evidence (see Section 5.3.2 'Murder and manslaughter: what does "intention" mean?'). If D knows that their representation will cause loss to V or expose V to the risk of loss, D intends that consequence. Gain and loss are defined by s.5(2) and (3) of the act:

- (2) 'Gain' and 'loss'
  - (a) extend only to gain or loss in money or other property;
  - (b) include any such gain or loss whether temporary or permanent;

and 'property' means any property whether real or personal (including things in action and other intangible property).

(3) Gain' includes a gain by keeping what one has, as well as a gain by getting what one does not have.

**page 185**
##### **Activity 12.23**

**Read Wilson, Section 15.1.C.1 'Fraud by false representation', Section (b) '***Mens rea***' and decide, giving reasons, whether the following representations are capable of resulting in a conviction of fraud.**

- **a. Adam promises to marry Eve in order to encourage her to agree to sexual intercourse.**
- **b. Adam tells people in a queue for a concert that he has a bad back in order to gain a better place in the queue.**
- **c. Eve misrepresents her golf handicap in order to be permitted to join a top club.**

**Note**: The gain or loss can be temporary or permanent, so making a misrepresentation to induce a loan of a car or money, or to gain time to pay a debt would be covered. In this latter example, fraud is constituted since 'gain' includes a gain by keeping what one has, as well as a gain by getting what one does not have. 'Loss' includes a loss by not getting what one might get, as well as a loss by parting with what one has.

There are four possible cases of this *mens rea* requirement.

- 1. The intention to make a gain for oneself by false representation (this will be the most usual case).
- 2. The intention to make a gain for someone else, for example giving a false reference to secure someone a job or a loan.
- 3. The intention to cause a loss to another. Usually this will go hand-in-hand with an intention to make a gain, either for oneself or for another, but it will include cases where the representor's purpose is purely destructive. Here is an example.

##### **Illustration 12.7**

**Janice, a committed vegetarian, places an advertisement in the** *Daily Globe* **newspaper, implying that the hotdogs of HotdiggetyDog hotdog manufacturers actually contain dog meat. The representation, which is false, is made in an attempt to damage sales of HotdiggetyDog meat products.**

This is fraud, because of Janice's intention to cause financial damage to HotdiggetyDog.

4. The intention not to cause a loss to the representee but to expose them to the risk of loss (this is more unusual).

##### **Illustration 12.8**

- **a. A, a mortgage broker, puts false earnings particulars on clients' mortgage forms to induce the lender to lend to her clients.**
- **b. B, a financial adviser, advises his client, C, to invest a large amount of money in X company, telling him it is a good investment. He knows that the investment is risky but hopes that the investment pays off and will advance his reputation as an adviser.**

A is guilty of fraud. Her liability turns on the fact that although she does not intend to cause the lender any loss, she does intend to expose the lender to the **risk** of loss, namely the risk that the borrowers may default (*Allsop* (1977) 64 Cr App R 29). B is also guilty of fraud for the same reason.

**Dishonesty**

The final *mens rea* element is dishonesty. Dishonesty, in this context, is *Ivey* dishonesty. There is no equivalent to s.2 of the Theft Act 1968 in the Fraud Act 2006. This means that a person who makes a false representation in order to gain what they believe they are in law entitled to is not automatically to be acquitted: it will be a matter for the jury. This was made clear in the pre-2006 Act case of *Woolven* (1983) 77 Cr App R 231 and one must assume the position is unaltered.

#### **12.3.2 Fraud by failing to disclose information**

This provision is probably unnecessary since a failure to disclose information which one has a duty to disclose counts as a representation for the purpose of s.2 of the Fraud Act 2006. Section 3 was included in order to simplify the proof of guilt. Section 3 allows a conviction simply upon proof of the duty to disclose and the failure to do so with the

**page 186**
relevant intent. The important aspect of s.3 is the requirement that the defendant be under a legal duty of disclosure: a moral duty is not enough. The concept of 'legal duty' is explained in the Law Commission's Report on Fraud, which said:

Such a duty may derive from statute (such as the provisions governing company prospectuses), from the fact that the transaction in question is one of the utmost good faith (such as a contract of insurance), from the express or implied terms of a contract, from the custom of a particular trade or market, or from the existence of a fiduciary relationship between the parties (such as that of agent and principal).

So an art dealer would not commit the offence if they bought a painting at a car boot sale knowing that the painting was worth a thousand times the asking price, as they have only a moral duty of disclosure.

 *Mens rea***: failing to disclose information**

The *mens rea* for s.3 of the Fraud Act is as for s.2. There is no requirement that the defendant be aware that they are under a legal duty of disclosure, although evidence of lack of awareness will, no doubt, influence the jury's assessment of dishonesty. Section 3 states:

- (1) A person is in breach of this section if he
  - (a) dishonestly fails to disclose to another person information which he is under a legal duty to disclose, and
  - (b) intends, by failing to disclose the information—
    - (i) to make a gain for himself or another, or
    - (ii) to cause loss to another or to expose another to a risk of loss.

The *mens rea* for s.4 is as for s.2. There is no requirement that the defendant be aware that they are under a duty to safeguard the other's financial interests, although evidence of lack of awareness will, no doubt, influence the jury's assessment of dishonesty.

Fraud by abuse of position

(1) A person is in breach of this section if he –

(a) occupies a position in which he is expected to safeguard, or not to act against, the financial interests of another person,

- (b) dishonestly abuses that position, and
- (c) intends, by means of the abuse of that position –
- (i) to make a gain for himself or another, or
- (ii) to cause loss to another or to expose another to a risk of loss.
- (2) A person may be regarded as having abused his position even though his conduct consisted of an omission rather than an act.

The Law Commission described the type of relationships intended to be covered by fraud by abuse of position as follows:

The necessary relationship will be present between trustee and beneficiary, director and company, professional person and client, agent and principal, employee and employer, or between partners. It may arise otherwise, for example within a family, or in the context of voluntary work, or in any context where the parties are not at arm's length. In nearly all cases where it arises, it will be recognised by the civil law as importing fiduciary duties, and any relationship that is so recognised will suffice. We see no reason, however, why the existence of such duties should be essential. (para.7.3)

Whether a person occupies a position in which they are expected to safeguard the interests of another is a question of law for the judge. Usually this will be because the relationship, as in the case of trustee/beneficiary, contains, or is constituted by, explicit duties of acting in the other's interests or not acting against those interests. It may, however, simply be understood as where A permits B to use her apartment while she

**page 187**
is on holiday. It goes without saying that B would abuse his licence if he were to use A's apartment to deal in drugs or sell weapons from.

**Note:** Students, when answering problem questions, often ignore s.2 and go straight to s.3. This is bad practice and illustrates the importance of identifying the (false) representation. You should generally only use s.3 as a default option, that is, where, having concluded that s.2 is or is not available and why, you go on to consider the alternative possibility of liability under s.3. All of the examples given in the illustrations and activities in this section are, first and foremost, cases of fraud by false representation (s.2). Consider, for example, Activities 12.12–12.20. A student who fails to analyse each of these activities by reference to s.2, and who simply talks about whether Adam, Clare and Jane are under a duty of disclosure and so liable under s.3 for not making disclosure, misses the whole point of these questions and would not do very well! So, what answer did you give to in relation to Adam and his BMW?

#### **12.3.3 Obtaining services dishonestly**

Section 11 of the Fraud Act 2006 replaces s.2 of the Theft Act 1978. It covers any case where services, for which payment would be expected, are obtained as a result of dishonest conduct. By s.11:

- (1) A person is guilty of an offence under this section if he obtains services for himself or another –
  - (a) by a dishonest act, and
  - (b) in breach of subsection (2).

The new offence differs from the old one by constituting the conduct element as any form of dishonest conduct rather than the deception required by s.2.

 *Actus reus***: obtaining services dishonestly**

Under the previous law it was an offence only where there was a deception. Now any dishonest act will be covered. The difference in coverage can be seen in the following example.

##### **Illustration 12.9**

**D parks her car in a pay-and-display car park. She does not pay for a ticket, hoping that she will return before a ticket inspector arrives.** 

Under the Theft Act 1978 this would not be an offence under s.2 as no false representation has been made. It is, however, an offence under s.11 because D has obtained a service and her conduct is dishonest.

##### **Illustration 12.10**

**Other cases of obtaining services dishonestly include the following.**

- **a. Entering a cinema without paying.**
- **b. Having a haircut without paying.**
- **c. Obtaining chargeable data or software (e.g. music downloads) over the internet without paying.**
- **d. Ordering a meal in a restaurant knowing you have no means to pay (also fraud by false representation).**
- **e. Attaching a decoder to a TV to access chargeable satellite services without paying.**
- **f. Using the services of a members' club without paying and/or without being a member.**

Section 11 also differs from ss.2, 3 and 4 of the Fraud Act 2006 in the *actus reus* requirement that the service be actually obtained. In this respect it is similar to the offence it replaced. However, where the relevant services are obtained as a result of a false representation, rather than by some other form of dishonest act, it will be possible to proceed under either section.

**page 188**
##### **Illustration 12.11**

**a. Adam parks his car in a pay and display car park. Eve, who is about to leave the car park, gives Adam her unexpired ticket. Adam places the ticket on his windscreen.** 

Adam is guilty under s.11. He is also guilty of fraud by false representation. By putting the ticket on his windscreen he is impliedly representing that he has paid for it. The gain he makes is keeping the fee due.

 **b. Mary untruthfully tells the sales assistant in a cinema that she is underage so as to be allowed in at a lower price.**

Since Mary is not a minor, she is guilty of fraud by false representation. The gain she intends to make is the money she is enabled to keep in her pocket by her false representation as to her age. She is also guilty of obtaining services dishonestly.

**What conduct does 'obtaining services' cover?**

Subsection 11(2) clarifies what is mean by 'obtaining services'. As with the previous offence, it refers to a narrower range of conduct than you might think.

- (2) A person obtains services in breach of this subsection if
  - (a) they are made available on the basis that payment has been, is being or will be made for or in respect of them,
  - (b) he obtains them without any payment having been made for or in respect of them or without payment having been made in full, and
  - (c) when he obtains them, he knows
    - (i) that they are being made available on the basis described in paragraph (a), or
    - (ii) that they might be,

but intends that payment will not be made, or will not be made in full.

Subsection 11(2) makes it clear that only services made available on the basis that payment has been, is being or will be made for or in respect of them are covered.

##### **Activity 12.24**

**How good are your statutory interpretation skills? Read s.11(2) and consider whether the following situations are examples of obtaining services dishonestly.**

- **a. D, in order to avoid paying a charge at his local swimming pool, sneaks into a school's pool, use of which is restricted to school pupils on a non fee-paying basis. Is this an offence under the Fraud Act 2006?**
- **b. Adam and Eve pretend to be Muslims in order to get their child into a fee-paying school, restricted to pupils of that religion. They are, in fact, Christians.**
- **c. D, in order to avoid paying a full charge at her local swimming pool, pretends to be a pensioner.**
- **d. D, in order to see an adult film, tells the assistant that he is 18 when he is only 16.**

**Are you happy with your answers? Now look at Wilson, Section 15.2 'Obtaining services dishonestly' to see if you were right.**

 *Mens rea***: obtaining services dishonestly**

The offence requires *Ivey* dishonesty, knowledge that payment is required or might be, and an intention not to pay for the service or not to pay in full. Section 2 of the Theft Act 1968 does not apply.

#### **12.3.4 Making off without payment**

Section 3 of the Theft Act 1978, which is still in force, provides:

**page 189**
- (1) Subject to subsection (3) below, a person who, knowing that payment on the spot for any goods supplied or service done is required or expected from him, dishonestly makes off without having paid as required or expected and with intent to avoid payment of the amount due shall be guilty of an offence.
- (2) For purposes of this section 'payment on the spot' includes payment at the time of collecting goods on which work has been done or in respect of which service has been provided.
- (3) Subsection (1) above shall not apply where the supply of the goods or the doing of the service is contrary to law, or where the service done is such that payment is not legally enforceable.

This offence is designed to enable a prosecution where, although the defendant has acted dishonestly, it may be difficult to prove or prevent fraud or theft. It is easier to prove that a driver has dishonestly made off without paying for their petrol than to prove that they had an intention not to pay when first filling up the car – which would ground a charge of theft or fraud.

##### **Activity 12.25**

**At examination time you should be wary of putting undue emphasis on this offence in cases where theft, fraud or obtaining services dishonestly are also present. This offence is best thought of as an offence of last resort, for use where proving another offence may be difficult. For example, read Wilson, Section 15.2.A '***Actus reus***' and answer the following question.**

**While out shopping, Yuri sees a shirt priced £50. He swaps the price tag for one marked £30 and pays the lower price. Yuri buys a DVD and pays for it with a £10 note. The shop assistant mistakenly gives him change for a £20 note. Yuri realises this once he is outside the shop but keeps the money. What offences, if any, have been committed?**

**In this question most of the marks would be awarded for discussion of theft and fraud in relation to the swapping of the price tags. Can you see why it is a case of both fraud and theft? Read Wilson, Sections 15.2.A '***Actus reus***' and 15.1.C 'Fraud'. In relation to the mistake question your discussion should again concentrate on theft. Only then consider whether there is a making off (see Wilson, Sections 15.3.A.1 'Making off' and 15.3.A.3 'Without having paid as required or expected'). Has Yuri made off without paying as required or expected in the light of the mistake made? No feedback provided.**

*Actus reus***: making off without payment**

A person can be liable only if they have **made off from the spot** where payment was due. Liability turns therefore on whether payment is due and, if so, where that spot is and whether D has departed from it. In *McDavitt* [1981] Crim LR 843, D, following an argument about his bill, made for the restaurant door having refused to pay for his meal. He was stopped and the police were called. D admitted having intended to leave without paying. A submission of no case to answer was accepted on a charge of making off without payment. The Court of Appeal ruled that 'making off' means making off from the spot where payment is required or expected. In this case the spot was the restaurant. The jury should have been directed that it could not convict of this offence but it was open to them to convict of an attempt.

Compare *Moberly* v *Alsop* [1992] COD 190, in which D travelled on a train without paying for a ticket. She was apprehended, having gone through the ticket barrier, and charged with making off without paying. She argued that she had not made off without paying because the spot for paying was the ticket office and she had not made off from there. Indeed, she had never been there! This argument was rejected.

##### **Activity 12.26**

**Why was the argument in** *Moberly* **v** *Alsop* **rejected? When you have thought about the answer, read Wilson, Section 15.3.A.1 'Making off', Section (a) 'From the spot where payment is due or expected' to see if your reasoning was correct.**

**page 190**
A person commits the offence only if, when making off, payment on the spot is required or expected. If, therefore, the expectation is that D will be 'billed' for the goods or services they are not guilty, even if it was their intention when making off that they would not pay. So also D will not commit the offence if there has been a breach of contract or if the contract was otherwise unenforceable. It was stated in *R* v *Wilkinson* [2018] EWCA Crim 2154 that a taxi fare cannot be lawfully due unless and until the driver has taken the passenger to the requested destination, or to the point where the passenger asks to be let out of the taxi, thereby varying the destination. As a result, the offence was not committed where, following a dispute between a passenger and driver, the driver told the passenger that, if she was going to complain, she could get out of the taxi immediately at a point short of her destination, which offer she refused.

Making off takes no particular form. A person can make off by stealth, or brazenly without any form of dissimulation. A question does, however, surround the status of permitted departures, as when a customer dupes a creditor into allowing them to depart by pretending to have left their wallet at home. Is this a making off? In *Vincent* [2001] EWCA Crim 295, the Court of Appeal concluded that it was not, since the effect of the deception is to pre-empt any expectation that payment would be made on the spot. Fraud could have been charged, but only if it could be proved that D had at some stage decided not to pay before receiving any goods or services. Under these circumstances D would in this case, by staying on in the hotel, have been impliedly representing that he intended to pay for the goods or services when he did not (*DPP* v *Ray* [1974] AC 370).

##### **Activity 12.27**

**Read Wilson, Section 15.2.A '***Actus reus***' for a discussion of this problem.**

 *Mens rea***: making off without payment**

The *mens rea* for s.3 of the Fraud Act 2006 is dishonesty and an intention to avoid payment of the amount due. Significantly, s.3 does not state that the intention must be to make permanent default. The commonsense view is this should not be the case because having to prove D intended to make **permanent** default will make the prosecution's burden of proof rather difficult. It is easy to claim that one intended to pay later and difficult to disprove this beyond reasonable doubt. Nevertheless in *Allen* [1985] AC 1029, the House of Lords held that the offence was constituted only upon proof of an intention permanently to avoid paying the amount due. So a hotel customer who checked out without paying did not commit the offence if he was temporarily financially embarrassed and intended to pay later.

##### **Activity 12.28**

**In** *Lawrence* **[1972] AC 626, the House of Lords refused to read the words 'without the transferor's consent' into the definition of appropriation for the purpose of theft, saying if Parliament had wanted this it would have said so. In the case of** *Allen***, the House of Lords did read into the words of the provision the word 'permanently' after 'intention'. In so doing it has rendered the offence 'toothless'. Is this a case of double standards and do you agree with the decision in** *Allen***?**

**No feedback provided.**
