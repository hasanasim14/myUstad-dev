# How can the chain of causation be broken?

Professor William Wilson

Criminal Law

• A chain of causation begins with the defendant's wrongful act or omission. It ends with the victim's death or other harm unless something happens subsequently to break the chain.

## The chain of causation: The story so far

- D cannot escape liability by claiming that other causes contributed to the outcome.
- *Benge* (1865)
- *Pagett* (1983)
- *People v Clark* 106 Cal App 2d 271
- *Cheshire* (1991)
- *Roberts* (1967)

## Breaking the chain of causation: Novus actus interveniens

Q. When will a subsequent act or event break the chain of causation?

- A i. In the case of acts of the victim when they are voluntary and independent.
  - ii. In the case of acts of third parties when they are voluntary and independent
  - iii. In the case of events when they are unforeseeable or abnormal.

## Illustrations

- **Case 1**  D stabs V. V is taken to hospital where he is shot dead by X, a terrorist.
- **Case 2**  D stabs V. V is taken to hospital where V dies when an earthquake hits the hospital causing the roof to collapse on top of him.

Acts of the Victim will break the chain of causation

• If voluntary, ie free and informed *R v Kennedy* (2008) HL

What does free and informed mean?

• *R v Rebelo* [2021] 4 W.L.R 52

## Acts of the victim: Judgement of the Court of Appeal

- 21. If this was a fully free, voluntary and informed decision, or may have been, that means that as a matter of law, her death was caused by her free choice, because in those circumstances, the defendant only set the scene for her to make that decision, but he did not cause her death.
- 22. What does a fully free, voluntary and informed decision mean? Whether a decision is fully free, voluntary and informed will be a matter of degree. It will be for you to judge whether all the relevant factors in this case, including her eating disorder and her mental health generally, were such that you can be sure that her decision to take the DNP was not fully free, voluntary and informed.

*Acts of the victim*

• *R v Field (Benjamin Luke)* [2021] EWCA Crim 380

- Victim commits suicide following D's unlawful act of violence
- When, if at all, will the victim's suicide following an act of violence by the accused break the chain of causation?
- *R v Wallace* CA (2018)

## Judgement of Sharp LJ in *R v Wallace*

Sharp LJ, in Wallace said the jury should be directed as follows:

(a) Are you sure that the D's unlawful act of throwing acid over V was a significant and operating cause of death? The injuries do not need to be the only cause of death but they must play more than a minimal part in causing V's death.

Consider all the circumstances, including the nature and extent of V's injuries, the passage of time, intervening events, the involvement of the doctors in carrying out the voluntary euthanasia at V's request, what V was told and what he said.

If your answer is yes, proceed to question 3(b). If you are not sure, your verdict on count 1 will be not guilty.

(b) Are you sure that at the time of the acid attack it was reasonably foreseeable that the D would commit suicide as a result of his injuries? In answering this question consider all the circumstances, including the nature of the attack, what D did and said at the time and whether or not V's decision to undergo voluntary euthanasia fell within the range of responses which might have been expected from a victim in his situation. If your answer is yes, your verdict on count 1 will be guilty. If your answer is no, your verdict on count 1 will be not guilty.

## Acts of third parties

Acts of third parties will break the chain of causation if voluntary and independent of the accused's act.

- *People v Elder* (1884)
- *Rafferty* (2009)

Remember: Third parties reacting to the harm done by A do not generally break the chain of causation

- *Pagett* (1983)
- *Cheshire* (1991)

### Acts of strangers

- This principle that acts of strangers break the chain of causation, if they are voluntary and independent does not apply in **strict liability offences** if the harm was still attributed to the defendant's commercial activities
  - *Environmental Agency v Empress Cars*

## Abnormal Event Intervening

- An abnormal event may break the chain of causation if it is independent of A's act.
  - *Bush v Commonwealth* (1880)
- But not if the risk of it happening was created by or increased by A's act.
  - *The harlot's case* (1560)
  - *R v Corbett* (1996)
