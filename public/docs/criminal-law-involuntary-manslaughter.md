criminal Homicide --> Involuntary manslaughter (killing without an intent to kill) --> Gross Negligence, Constructuve manslaughter, Reckless manslaughter
                |---> Murder (Killing with an intent to kill or to cause GBH) --> Voluntary manslaughter if partial defense of: Loss of control s.54, Coroners and Justice Act 2009, Diminished responsibility: s.2(1) Homicide Acr 1957, Sucide pact: s.4(1) Homicide Act 1957

## Common elements in criminal homicide

- Unlawful killing
  - Accidental deaths excluded
  - Cannot consent to death *R (Nicklinson) v Ministry of Justice* (2014); *Nicklinson v UK (Admissibility)* (2478/15) (2015) 61 EHRR SE7
- Human victim *Enoch* (1833) 5 C& P 539, 172 ER 1089*; Airedale NHS Trust v Bland* [1993] AC 789 HL

## What is manslaughter?

- Unlawful killing without intent
- Involuntary manslaughter can be committed in three ways:
  - Constructive manslaughter
  - Gross negligence
  - Reckless manslaughter
- Manslaughter is very broad offence and sentencing is discretionary

### Broadness of manslaughter

- Manslaughter is very broad offence and sentencing is discretionary
- Includes so called one punch killer

## Unlawful act or constructive manslaughter

### **Unlawful and dangerous act (constructive) manslaughter**

Three elements that need to be satisfied to find liability:
1. There myst be a basic crime in which the manslaughter charge builds ('unlawful')
2. The basic crime must cause the death (causation)
3. The basic act must be 'dangerous'

### 1. Unlawful act

- The unlawful act must be a crime not a tort or moral wrong
- It should be an act, not an omission (*Lowe* (1973))
- The unlawful act must be complete, e.g. actus reus AND mens rea (*Lamb* (1967))
- There is NO additional mens rea element for unlawful act manslaughter, just the mens rea for the unlawful offence

### 2. Causation (must cause death)

Unlawful act --(causation link) --> Death

#### Complexities with causation I

- Absolutely essential to find a causal link between death and the unlawful act but at times complex:
- Drug supply cases
  - *Dias* (2001) supply not enough: causal chain broken by free act of taking the drug
  - *Kennedy No.2* (HL) (2007) D prepared syringe for V, who died. 'Joint administration'? No, V's act a free one in injecting.
  - 'law generally assumes existence of free will'
  - *Rogers* (2003) D played part in the mechanics of injection by applying tourniquet

#### Complexities with causation II: *Dhaliwal*

- Suicide of another
  - *Dhaliwal* (2006): a woman killed herself after prolonged abuse by her husband
  - Husband charged and acquitted of manslaughter

- Could psychological abuse constitute a crime?
- Could such abuse be the cause of suicide?
- Munro and Shah (2010):
  - 'the abuser does not pull the trigger or provide the rope. The victim may even see the act as a form of liberation…. But this does not mean that the actions of the abuser are not a significant cause of death, [or] that … taking one's life [reflects] voluntary agency'.

### 3. Unlawful act must be dangerous

- *Church* (1966): there must be an
  - 'act . . . Such that **all sober and reasonable people** would inevitably recognise must subject the other person to, **at least the risk of some harm** resulting therefrom, albeit **not serious harm**'.
- It is the reasonable person who would recognise the risk not a question of what D foresaw, so an objective test
- The risk is of some, albeit not serious, harm so no need for there to be a foreseeable risk of death (compare *Dawson* and *Watson*)

## Gross negligence manslaughter

GNM as per Adomako(1994)
1. duty of care
2. Breach of duty
3. whether that breach of duty caused the death of the victim
4. Breach of duty grossly negligent

### 1. Duty of care

- Adomako (1994): 'ordinary principles of … negligence apply'
  - Examples: duty of care in Doctor/ Patient relationship (Adomako);
- But the tort law principles are reset in the criminal law context (*Wacker (2002))*

### 2. Breach of duty of care

- How would a reasonable person have acted in the situation?
- Did D's conduct fall below how the reasonable person would have acted?
- Added dimension following *Rose* (2017): Would a reasonable person have foreseen a serious and obvious risk of death?
- The jury applies the reasonable person test to what was foreseeable *at the time* that D acted or omitted to act

### 3. Causation (must cause death)

Breach of Duty ---(causal link)--> Death

### Causation: drug cases?

- Unlike unlawful act manslaughter, D can in some circumstances be held liable for GNM for supplying drugs – if special relation applies (omission categories)
- See also, 'Bestival death: Ceon Broughton manslaughter conviction overturned' (18 August 2020)

<https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-53818931>

### *R v Evans*

- Rare gross negligence manslaughter charge after drug death
- Family history of addiction
- 'contributing to a dangerous situation'

## 4. The negligence must be gross

- Gross negligence means that it must involve a serious risk **to life** (*Misra* (2004))
- Adomako 'whether having regard to the risk of death involved, the conduct … was so bad in all the circs to amount to a criminal act or omission'


## Exam question (2017) preview

Imran and Ed, who were both in love with the same woman, had an argument. In the course of the argument Ed pushed Imran hard. Imran responded by pushing Ed equally hard. Ed fell over, cutting his arm badly. Imran tried to stop the bleeding with a handkerchief but was unable to do so because Ed was a haemophiliac which meant that his blood would not clot. Imran took Ed to the hospital but got stuck in traffic. By the time he had arrived at hospital Ed had died of blood loss.

Consider Imran's possible liability for constructive manslaughter.

### Summary on unlawful act and gross negligence manslaughter. You should be able to:

| Describe                                                   | Explain                                                                                                                   | Begin                                                                                                 |
