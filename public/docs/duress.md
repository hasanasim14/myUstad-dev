## Learning objectives

- Learning outcomes
- After completing this topic, you should be able to:
- Define duress
- State and explain the forms taken by duress
- State and discuss the elements of duress, including the requirement that only threats of death or serious injury can be used to ground the defence
- Understand the underlying requirement that the defendant's reaction to coercion was reasonable
- State and understand the crimes in respect of which duress is not a defence

## Duress

â€¢ *Was the accused 'or may have been, impelled to act as he did because as a result of what he reasonably believed to be the situation he feared that otherwise death or serious injury would result; second, if so, would a sober person of reasonable firmness, sharing the characteristics of the accused, have responded to the situation by acting as the accused did?'. (Lord Lane CJ in Graham 1982)*

## Sources of a threat

Two possible sources of the threat:

- Duress by threats threats issue from a wrongdoer
- Duress of circumstances threats issue from external circumstances

## Elements of Duress

A. Threats of serious injury or death are required
*Hasan* (2005) HL *Valderama Vega (1985) Quayle (2005) Regina v A (RJ)[2012] EWCA Crim 434; [2012] WLR (D) 76 R v Dao (2013)*

B. It must be a threat to D, or one of his family or close circle, or, to someone for whom D would reasonably regard himself as responsible: *Ortiz* (1986); *Shayler (2005) R v SL (2012).*

Illustration:

**X commands D, a taxidriver, to drive him and his gang to Wilton Bank where they are to execute a robbery. He tells D that if he does not do so he will kill, at random, an infant child at 10am the next day. D does as commanded.**

- C. The defendant's view of the facts should be reasonably entertained
- *Hasan* (2005), Re A (2012)

D. Reasonable standards of courage are required

- *Howe (1987) AC 417 the [jury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury) should consider:*
- *Would a [reasonable person](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_person) of ordinary courage sharing the defendant's characteristics have responded in the same way to the threats? (an objective test)*
- *It is not relevant that D is less steadfast that ordinary people. Hegarty (1994)*

E. There must have been no evasive action D could reasonably take

*Gill (1963) Hudson and Taylor (1975) Hasan (2005)*

F. D cannot rely on threats to which he has voluntarily laid himself open (prior fault)

 **Voluntary subjection to the risk of coercion**

- *Sharp* (1987)
- *Hasan (2006)*
- *Mullally* [2012] EWCA Crim 687

## Duress illustrations

- 1. Adam, a robber, jumps into Eve's car and threatens her with death if she doesn't drive him to the airport at top speed. Eve does so and is later charged with speeding.
- 2. Eve is driving her car at a safe speed in the city. She sees a lorry out of control behind her just about to crash into her car. She accelerates, breaking the speed limit to avoid the possibly fatal crash

## Exclusions

- Murder
- *Howe* (1987)
- Attempted Murder
- *Gotts* (1992)
- Duress is, however, an answer to conspiracy to murder *R v Ness* (2011)
