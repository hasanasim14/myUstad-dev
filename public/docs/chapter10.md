### **Introduction**

So far we have discovered that the prosecution bears the burden of proving that all the elements of the offence are present. It also bears the burden of disproving any defence for which D adduces evidence in support. In Chapters 11 and 12 we shall examine the core general defences. These are of two types.

### **10.1 The two types of defences**

There are two categories of defences – affirmative defences and failure of proof defences. The former defence blocks criminal liability although D has performed the *actus reus* of the offence with *mens rea*. The essence of such defences is that D is not denying that the elements of the offence are present. Rather D is seeking to excuse or justify what would otherwise be punishable conduct on the basis of the particular circumstances which led them to do what they did. For example, D may wish to adduce evidence that they shot V under coercion by a third party, or that they were acting in self-defence to prevent V shooting them or another person, or that they had lost their self control, having come upon V committing rape upon a child. Such defences are known as **affirmative defences** or defences of confession and avoidance, and we shall examine these in Chapter 11.

The type of defences we shall be dealing with in this chapter, **failure of proof defences***,* do not act outside the elements of the offence; rather they provide the evidential basis for a claim that one of these elements is lacking.

#### **Illustration 10.1**

**D, witnessed by a crowd of onlookers, aims his gun at V and shoots him dead.**

To gain a conviction for murder, the prosecution bears the burden of proving:

- that D's act caused V's death
- that D's shooting of the gun was actuated by an intention to kill V or cause him serious injury.

As you may appreciate, this should not be too difficult, given that there are:

- witnesses who saw D aim the gun and pull the trigger
- witnesses who saw V fall down immediately after the gun was fired
- doctors who will confirm that V's death was caused by the blood loss occasioned by the bullet entering V's body.

Indeed in a case like this, D's counsel will no doubt recommend that D plead guilty because the chances of an acquittal are next to nothing.

Occasionally, however, D may be able to deflect a finding that all the elements of offence are present despite the most compelling of physical evidence. For example, in this case D might adduce evidence suggesting that, although it might have appeared to the witnesses that he intended to kill V, in fact he did not. For instance, D might adduce evidence that he was intoxicated and that he thought V was a scarecrow, or that he was insane and thought V was the devil, or that he was sleepwalking and that he was quite unaware of what he was doing. If these claims may have been true, D is entitled to be acquitted since they amount to a plausible claim that one of the elements of the offence is missing (*mens rea*).

There are a number of defences whose function is to regulate the conditions under which a defendant is permitted to adduce evidence of this nature. The defences in question are known as **failure of proof** defences. They include intoxication, mistake, automatism and insanity. The scope of these defences is strictly controlled in order to ensure that a finding of accountability is not too easily deflected.

For both types of defences it is not enough for D simply to claim that they were sleepwalking or acting under duress to require the prosecution to prove otherwise. This would be too much of a burden on the prosecution. In order to ensure that D's claim is worthy of being taken seriously by the jury, D is required to adduce some evidence strong enough to introduce some reasonable doubt into a juror's mind as to whether the prosecution's case is as strong as it makes out. This might include, in connection with the claims raised by D in Illustration 10.1, medical evidence – for example a doctor's report that D was a serial sleepwalker. Or evidence from a witness that V had been seen lying drunk in a ditch an hour before the shooting. Or, in the case of an affirmative defence, evidence from a witness that V was a man known to exact compliance through violence and had been witnessed talking to D prior to the shooting.

**page 130**
In this chapter we will cover three failure of proof defences, namely involuntary conduct, insanity and intoxication.

### **10.2 Involuntary conduct**

Involuntary conduct is the prime example of a failure of proof defence, since it can be used to negate either *actus reus* or *mens rea*. This may be of considerable importance to the defence since it may be used to escape liability, even for strict liability crimes which do not require *mens rea*. The essence of the defence is that the criminal conduct complained of was not done by D: rather, it happened to them. In *Hill* v *Baxter* [1958] 1 QB 277 the defendant was charged with dangerous driving, having blacked out at the wheel. Although D's defence was disallowed by the Court of Appeal, it accepted, in the following famous statement of principle, that voluntariness of action was central to criminal responsibility even for strict liability offences.

there may be cases where the circumstances are such that the accused could not really be said to be driving at all. Suppose he had a stroke or an epileptic fit, both instances of what may properly be called acts of God; he might well be in the driver's seat even with his hands on the wheel, but in such a state of unconsciousness that he could not be said to be driving. A blow from a stone or an attack by a swarm of bees I think introduces some conception akin to *novus actus interveniens*.

You will understand from the above statement that the defence may take one of two forms.

- A loss of physical control over one's conduct.
- A loss of mental control due to a trigger such as a stroke or epileptic fit.

The criminal law has traditionally called both instances 'automatism'. In the words of Lord Denning in *Bratty* v *A-G of Northern Ireland* [1963] AC 386:

No act is punishable if it is done involuntarily: and an involuntary act in this context – some people nowadays prefer to speak of it as 'automatism' – means an act which is done by the muscles without any control by the mind...

#### **Activity 10.1**

**Learn Lord Denning's statement by heart: it is a good summary of the law.**

In this chapter we shall deal with the two forms of automatism separately, since certain biological or mental conditions which trigger involuntary behaviour may lead to distinct case outcomes.

#### **10.2.1 Physical involuntariness**

We have come across the concept of involuntary action already in the context of causation (see Chapter 4). You will remember that a person's conduct is causally effective only when it is voluntary. It is for this reason that in *Mitchell* (1983) it was Mitchell who was deemed to be the cause of the elderly woman's death rather than the man whom Mitchell caused to fall on top of her. In *Hill* v *Baxte*r (1958) above, an attack by a swarm of bees or blow on the head was said to be comparable.

Similar principles occur where something goes wrong with a car. For example, in *Burns* v *Bidder* [1967] 2 QB 227 a driver was charged with the offence of failing to accord precedence to a pedestrian on a crossing. His defence was that his action was involuntary as he had suffered brake failure. The court held that if this had happened without any fault on the part of the driver – for example because the defect was not the result of poor maintenance – then he was entitled to an acquittal. Even a strict liability offence, which this was, requires voluntary action to constitute the *actus reus*.

**page 131**
#### **10.2.2 Automatism**

The other form of involuntary behaviour, also known as automatism, occurs where the accused is effectively unconscious while committing the offence. Again, successful raising of this defence means that the accused is entitled to an absolute acquittal. There are, however, dangers attached to raising this defence; namely that the judge may treat the mental condition relied upon to support the defence as involving a 'disease of the mind'. This is dangerous because it may trigger the special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. Although the verdict is an acquittal, it is not an unqualified acquittal since it affords the judge a number of powers of disposal, including mandatory hospitalisation.

So in *Bratty* the defendant killed a young woman by strangling her with her own stockings. D pleaded automatism relying on evidence that he suffered from psychomotor epilepsy at the time of the offence, and had blacked out and knew nothing of what he had done. Lord Denning in the Court of Appeal ruled that the trial judge was correct in his ruling that D's mental condition was due to disease of the mind and could only be presented to the court as insanity. Although receiving the special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, D was committed indefinitely to a secure mental hospital. From his point of view, at least, a conviction might have been preferable.

In *Quick* [1973] QB 910, D was a psychiatric nurse working in a mental hospital. He was a diabetic. On the day in question he had taken insulin, had also taken alcohol and had eaten little food. For a diabetic this is a dangerous regime because it will induce hypoglycaemia, a deficiency of blood sugar which can impair consciousness and cause aggressive outbursts. And so it transpired. In this condition D attacked a patient, causing him injury, and was charged with assault.

In his defence D claimed that he lacked *mens rea* due to being in an automatic state brought on by hypoglycaemia. The judge refused to allow this defence to go to the jury, ruling that it was one of insanity. D changed his plea to guilty. He appealed on the ground that the judge was wrong to refuse to allow his condition to be presented as automatism as opposed to insanity. The Court of Appeal allowed his appeal on the basis that his hypoglycaemia was a condition that had been triggered by the taking of insulin, and so not a mental condition caused by a disease of the mind, but – like blows on the head or an attack by a swarm of bees – was caused by an external factor which deprives the actor temporarily of control over his actions. Lawton LJ explained it as:

…a malfunctioning of the mind of transitory effect caused by the application to the body of some external factor such as violence, drugs (including anaesthetics), alcohol or hypnotic influences.

##### **Activity 10.2**

**Read Wilson, Section 9.8.C 'Conditions of automatism' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. Why did Quick change his plea to guilty?**
- **b. Make a note all of the examples of conditions which have been successfully used to support a defence of automatism.**
- **c. Why was the defendant in** *T* **(1990) able to use her condition to support her claim of automatism but not the defendant in** *Rabey* **(1978)?**
- **d. Search the term 'confusional arousal' on the internet. Can you think of an example of how experiencing this condition might cause someone to perform a prohibited act?**

Success rates in using automatism as a defence are relatively poor. There are three reasons for this.

- Automatism can be used for all crimes, even crimes of strict liability where the prosecution does not need to prove fault on the part of the defendant. Driving offences are prime examples. As we know, the policy behind such offences is that it would be counterproductive to require proof of fault. If society wants to stop

**page 132**
bad driving, the best way is to make it known that whatever the excuse bad driving will be punished. In deference to this policy, the courts have shown a marked reluctance to allow no-fault liability to be undermined by a claim of automatism.

-  The defence cannot be relied upon if the defendant was at fault in inducing the condition.
-  The courts insist upon medical evidence to support the claim and, as can be seen from *Bratty* and *Quick*, even then the danger is that the defence will be construed as involving a disease of the mind. Underpinning such decisions is a judicial reluctance to allow an unqualified acquittal to those whose mental condition may reoccur, particularly if violence was involved.

These three reasons will now be explored.

#### **10.2.3 Strict liability offences**

We have seen that automatism can be used even for strict liability offences. This is because automatism is not simply a denial of *mens rea*; it is also a denial of *actus reus*. In *Burns* v *Bidder*, the accused escaped liability on the basis that he was not 'driving' his car, not on the basis that he was not at fault in driving it badly.

The courts have kept strictly to this idea that automatism can only operate to negate voluntary action not fault in strict liability offences. In *Neal* v *Reynolds* [1966] Crim LR 394, D was charged with failing to accord precedence to a pedestrian on a crossing. Like the defendant in *Burns* v *Bidder*, D's defence was that this was involuntary; he could not avoid failing to give precedence to the pedestrian because that same pedestrian had dashed out without warning and without giving him the chance to stop. The court refused the defence on the basis that D, despite the action of the pedestrian, was fully in control of his vehicle and so was not acting involuntarily.

Comparable decisions were reached in *Broome* v *Perkins* (1987) 85 Cr App R 321 and *A-G's Reference (No 2 of 1992)* [1994] QB 91, in both of which cases the defendant was charged with driving dangerously when their mind was not fully conscious due to matters outside their control – hypoglycaemia in the former, a trance-like state induced by the defendant's concentrated attention to the lines separating the motorway carriageways in the latter. Their defences of automatism failed on the ground that it was available only where there was a complete loss of conscious control.

#### **10.2.4 Prior fault**

The defendant in *Quick* was a touch fortunate in having his conviction quashed. If the trial judge had directed the jury as he ought, D would probably have been properly convicted at first instance. What the judge should have told the jury was that it should acquit if it thought D may not have been aware of what he was doing due to his hypoglycaemia **unless** he was at fault in getting himself into that condition. The jury may well have concluded that D was at fault, since a diabetic would usually know that after taking insulin it was important not to drink alcohol on an empty stomach. Lawton LJ made this clear when hearing the appeal: 'A self induced incapacity will not excuse... nor will one which could reasonably have been foreseen'.

In *Bailey* [1983] 1 WLR 760, on similar facts, the Court of Appeal ruled that what was important was not what 'could reasonably have been foreseen' but **what was foreseen** by the accused. Only if the accused foresaw that his failure to eat and drink properly might cause him to become 'aggressive, unpredictable and uncontrolled with the result that he may cause injury to others' would a conviction be proper.

These were not cases of self-induced automatism but preventable automatism. Cases of self-induced automatism are treated slightly differently. Where the defendant's automatism is the result of voluntary intoxication with drink or drugs, they are disabled from using it as a defence for all crimes except crimes of specific intent; that is, crimes where the prosecution has to show that the accused specifically intended the consequences of their act. For all other crimes voluntary intoxication is treated as a basis in itself for a conviction.

**page 33**
In *Lipman* [1970] 1 QB 152 the defendant went on an 'acid trip' (took the hallucinogenic drug, LSD) with his girlfriend. He awoke some time later to find her dead of suffocation; he had stuffed a sheet in her mouth while hallucinating that she was a snake. He was charged with manslaughter. D's defence of automatism was rejected on the basis that his condition was self-induced. If he had been charged with murder, which requires proof of a specific intent to kill or cause serious injury, he could have used the evidence of his acid trip to negate his *mens rea*. No such relief was available for manslaughter, however.

The rule that self-induced automatism is not a defence applies only where the defendant's intoxication was voluntary. If in *Lipman* the LSD tablet had been introduced into D's food without him knowing, or if his hallucination was caused by drugs taken under medical prescription, the intoxication would be involuntary and he would have been able to rely on it. In *Hardie* [1985] 1 WLR 64, the Court of Appeal added a further qualification, comparable with the decision in *Bailey*, that the voluntary consumption of a drug (here Valium) not known to result in unpredictable and aggressive behaviour could be relied upon in support of the defendant's claim (on a charge of arson) that he lacked awareness of what he was doing.

Both *Bailey* and *Hardie* are authorities for the broader proposition that, for crimes of *mens rea*, only those who are at fault in permitting themselves to lapse into aggressive and unpredictable behaviour are denied the defence. For crimes of negligence, automatism will not be a defence if the condition could have been prevented by the taking of reasonable care. In *Kay* v *Butterworth* (1945) 61 TLR 452, for example, it was affirmed that falling asleep at the wheel, or brake failure due to not servicing a car properly, is no defence to careless or dangerous driving. This is consistent with the point that taking a sedative would be no answer to a charge of dangerous or reckless driving. Indeed, if it resulted in the defendant falling asleep at the wheel, it would provide the prosecution with all the evidence it needed to secure the conviction!

#### **10.2.5 Insanity (insane automatism)**

As we have seen, automatism can be the result of loss of physical control or loss of mental control over one's actions. In the latter case, the defendant is relying upon a mental condition which rendered them unaware of what they were doing. By raising such evidence before the court, the defendant is, of course, putting their sanity at issue. In a number of cases a plea of automatism has been rejected by the court and construed as one of insanity. It is therefore important to be able to distinguish insanity (or insane automatism) from simple automatism. In the next section we will examine insanity in detail.

### **10.3 Insanity**

The defence of insanity is unusual in a number of ways. First, if successfully raised it will not result in an unqualified acquittal, but rather a special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. Upon such verdict, the court has a wide-ranging dispositive discretion which includes hospital order, guardianship, absolute discharge and supervision (Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991). Before 1991 the only power available was mandatory indefinite committal to a mental hospital at the Home Secretary's discretion (Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964, s.5 and Schedule 1; see R.D. Mackay *Mental condition defences in the criminal law*. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995) [ISBN 9780198259954] pp.106–8). As a result, the defence was understandably unpopular with defendants who might otherwise have wished to avail themselves of it (R.D. Mackay 'Fact and fiction about the insanity defence' [1990] *Crim LR* 247). The case law contains a number of instances of defendants relying upon non-insane automatism, who changed their plea to guilty upon the trial judge ruling that their defence was properly one of insanity (see, for example, *Hennessy* below). Even a 'life' sentence for murder may be preferable to an indefinite committal – which might really mean life (although as Mackay's research shows (1990, pp.254–5), judges did not always implement the mandatory hospital order). Although the defence has not gained significantly in popularity since the change in the law, it seems likely to

**page 134**
do so, given the wide-ranging discretion now available (R. Mackay and G. Kearns 'The continued underuse of unfitness to plead and the insanity defence' [1994] *Crim LR* 576; plea of not guilty by reason of insanity used in only five cases in 1992).

A second unusual characteristic is that, unlike other defences, it may be raised by either defence or prosecution (although in *Price* [1963] 2 QB 1, Lawton J appeared to dissent from this view). The prosecution may raise it when the defendant puts his sanity at issue, for example by pleading diminished responsibility (Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964, s.6) or non-insane automatism (*Bratty* v *A-G for Northern Ireland* [1963] AC 386 at 411–12 per Lord Denning; *Dickie* [1984] 3 All ER 173 at 180 per Watkin LJ). When this occurs the standard of proof is the criminal standard (beyond reasonable doubt: *Podola* [1959] 3 All ER 418; *Robertson* [1968] 3 All ER 557; see also though *Bratty* at 411–12 per Lord Denning). When raised by the defence, the burden of proof is with the defendant rather than, as is usual, the prosecution. A right of appeal exists against a special verdict even though technically the defendant has been found not guilty (Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964, s.2). See the fascinating account of the interplay of substantive and procedural aspects of the insanity defence in A. Loughnan 'Manifest madness: towards a new understanding of the insanity defence' (2007) *MLR* 379.

#### **10.3.1 The** *M'Naghten* **rules**

The legal notion of insanity is captured and defined in a statement of principle which derives from a famous case in 1843 when Daniel M'Naghten, in an attempt to assassinate the prime minister, instead succeeded in killing his private secretary. M'Naghten was found not guilty by reason of insanity on the grounds that he was suffering an insane delusion that the prime minister and his constituents were conspiring against him at the time of his act. So incensed were the public at M'Naghten's acquittal that the House of Lords asked a panel of judges to establish rules governing the defence of insanity. These rules are known as the *M'Naghten* rules.

On the precise issue in the case, namely insane delusions, their Lordships concluded that an insane delusion would act as a defence only if, assuming the delusion was true, it would have entitled the defendant to do as he did. In *R* v *Oye* [2013] EWCA Crim 1725 the defendant attacked police officers under the insane delusion that they were evil spirits attacking him. His defence of self-defence was rejected by the Court of Appeal. The correct defence was that of insanity. Assuming his delusion to be true he would have been justified in using force to defend himself. So also, if M'Naghten's insane delusion was that Sir Robert Peel was about to kill him, the defence would have stood, since killing in self-defence is permitted. On the facts, however, M'Naghten's insane delusion was insufficient; that someone is conspiring against you does not excuse or justify killing the conspirator. The body of the *M'Naghten* rules is as follows.

[E]very man is presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved…and…to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at the time of committing the act the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or as not to know that what he was doing was wrong.

##### **Activity 10.3**

**Learn the** *M'Naghten* **rules by heart: they represent the law and must therefore be known.**

As can be appreciated from this statement, insanity like automatism is not simply a denial of *mens rea.* An insane person may intend what they are doing without appreciating its true quality or that it is (legally) wrong. In *Loake* the defendant sent a very large number of text messages over a period of time to her husband, from whom she was separated. She was convicted of harassment contrary to s.2 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 in the magistrates' court. L appealed against her conviction and sentence on the basis that she was not guilty by reason of her insanity. At Crown Court, the judge ruled that the defence of insanity was not available for an offence of harassment as the offence did not require proof that she knew that what she was doing was wrongful. Her further appeal was successful. Insanity is a defence to all crimes

**page 135**
including crimes of strict liability and crimes of objective fault. In other words, like automatism, it is not simply a denial of *mens rea*. A person may know what they are doing but may not realise, because of a disease of the mind, that it mounts to harassment. This is what happened here. Her defect of reason prevented her from understanding the nature and quality of her act and that what she was doing was wrong.

As may also be appreciated from this statement, there is a considerable overlap between insanity and automatism. A defendant who suffers from a defect of reason, which renders them unaware of what they are doing or its nature and quality, can be in either a state of sane or insane automatism. The difference between them lies in the cause of that disorder. With insanity, the defect of reason results from a disease of the mind. So what exactly is a disease of the mind?

#### **10.3.2 Disease of the mind**

The notion of a disease of the mind owes nothing to the current state of knowledge regarding mental illness: it is a matter of legal rather than medical definition. The current legal position is that many who would not be considered to have a disease of the mind by any ordinary measure are so treated by the criminal law.

The ruling test for a disease of the mind is that of Devlin J in the case of *Kemp* [1957] 1 QB 399. The defendant attacked his wife with a hammer, causing her grievous bodily harm. The medical evidence showed that D suffered from arterial-sclerosis, a condition which restricts the flow of blood to the brain, and this caused a temporary lapse of consciousness. D sought to raise the defence of automatism. Devlin J rejected this defence, ruling that it was one of insanity.

…The condition of the brain is irrelevant and so is the question of whether the condition of the mind is curable or incurable, transitory or permanent... Hardening of the arteries is a disease which is…capable of affecting the mind in such a way as to cause a defect, temporarily or permanently, of its reasoning, understanding and so on, and so is in my judgment a disease of the mind...within the meaning of the rules.

The deceptively simple result of this test is that defects of reason are treated as insanity if triggered by an internal condition, but as (simple) automatism if triggered by an external cause.

##### **Activity 10.4**

**Read Wilson, Section 9.9.A.3 'Disease of the mind' and make a note of the three different tests of 'disease of the mind'.** 

- **a. Do you prefer the** *Devlin* **test or one of the other two?**
- **b. Why have the courts ignored medical definitions in deciding the meaning of a disease of the mind?**
- **c. Learn the** *Devlin* **test by heart: it is the current law governing the meaning and scope of disease of the mind.**

##### **No feedback provided.**

Although a simple test, the *Devlin* test is by no means a convincing one. Consider for example, the medical condition of diabetes. Diabetes can produce defects of reason involving loss of conscious awareness in two separate ways. It can produce hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) where the person takes insulin but does not compensate its effects with an appropriate dietary regime. It can also produce hyperglycaemia (excess blood sugar) where the person fails to take their insulin as instructed. Both conditions can result in the kind of mental confusion, unconscious action and/or aggression which can trigger criminal activity.

As we have seen (*Quick*), if D suffers hypoglycaemia (without fault on their part) induced by the taking of insulin (external trigger), the condition is treated as one of simple automatism and they receive an unqualified acquittal *(Bingham* [1991] Crim LR 433, in which a conviction for theft was quashed**)**. If, however, D suffers hyperglycaemia as a result of **not** taking insulin (internal cause), the condition is treated as one of insanity (insane automatism) (*Hennessy* (1989) 89 Cr App R 10). In short: similar condition, totally different outcome.

**page 136**
On the basis of this internal/external test, acts of violence committed while sleepwalking (*Burgess* (1991) 93 Cr App R 41; *Lowe* (2005)); while suffering an epileptic seizure (*Sullivan* [1984] AC 156) or while suffering clinical depression (*Rabey* (1980) DLR 193) have all been designated the result of conditions of insanity rather than of simple automatism. In the case of sleepwalking, this is particularly ironic given that this was traditionally proposed as the classic example of automatism (see *Bratty* quotation in Section 3.1.2 of this module guide). This is no longer the case, at least if (as it usually will) it stems from an internal susceptibility.

###### **Activity 10.5**

**Read Wilson, Section 9.9.A.3 'Disease of the mind' and note down as many difficulties associated with the 'internal/external cause' test of insanity/automatism as you can find. Concentrate particularly on the discussions relating to diabetes and sleepwalking. When you have done this, consider whether Hennessy would have been in a stronger position to claim automatism if he had forgotten or failed to take his insulin due to:**

- **a. the sudden death of his child**
- **b. a fire at his home**
- **c. an unlawful attack on his person**
- **d. theft of the insulin.**

#### **10.3.3 Second limb of the** *M'Naghten* **rules**

The *M'Naghten* rules also permit the insanity defence for those who know what they are doing but do not 'know that it is wrong'. This has subsequently been construed to mean 'legally' wrong, so is not available to a person who believes that they have God's consent to commit the relevant crime or whose disordered mental state convinces them that the criminal law is overridden by the demands of morality. So in *Windle* [1952] 2 QB 826, D, a husband who killed his suicidal wife at her request believing, in his mentally disordered state, that it was right to do so, was unable to raise the defence. When he was arrested, D had said to the police, 'I suppose they will hang me for this'. In saying this, D signalled his understanding that what he was doing was legally wrong. That was unfortunate enough. More unfortunately, however, at that time murder was a capital offence.

### **10.4 Intoxication**

Intoxication, like other failure of proof defences, is not a defence in itself. Indeed, it is more like an anti-defence. If a person kills another, inflamed by drink, or drives a car dangerously due to the influence of alcohol, this exacerbates rather than excuses or mitigates the wrong. Intoxication operates, like automatism, to provide an evidential basis for a claim of no *mens rea*. Consider again the case of *Lipman* above. Without the evidence of D having taken LSD, the jury would have had no reason to believe his action was not deliberately undertaken and so, in the absence of such evidence, would no doubt have convicted him of murder. People do not tend to stuff sheets into the mouths of others unless they want to kill them; and the jury would know this. As it was, the evidence was forthcoming and so it could convict only of manslaughter. So something, at least, went right for Lipman!

It is easy to forget this aspect of the so-called defence of intoxication, namely that it is of evidential value only and that its value is not by way of excusing D's wrongdoing but rather to substantiate D's claim that they lacked the *mens rea* (i.e. the intention, knowledge or foresight) of the crime charged. It is for this reason that intoxication – even involuntary intoxication – is not a defence to crimes of negligence or strict liability **unless it can be presented as one of automatism**. So in *Blakely and Sutton* [1991] RTR 405, D spiked B's soft drink with alcohol at a party. B, unaware of this, drove home and was stopped by police on the way and breathalysed. B was properly found guilty of driving with excess alcohol. The fact that he was unaware of his condition is no answer to a strict liability crime which does not require proof of fault.

**page 137**
#### **Activity 10.6**

**Read Wilson, Sections 9.8.A 'Automatism and crimes of** *mens rea***', 9.8.B 'Automatism, negligence and strict liability' and 9.8.C 'Conditions of automatism'. How might a person be able to avoid liability for a strict liability crime or crime of negligence by pleading involuntary intoxication?**

**Hint: Think of a strict liability driving offence and a possible neurological outcome of involuntary intoxication which prevents that offence from taking place.**

#### **No feedback provided.**

For crimes of *mens rea*, if D has the *mens rea* for the crime charged they will remain guilty **even though they would not have committed the offence if sober**. This important point of law was confirmed in *Kingston* [1995] 2 AC 355. D committed a sexual assault on V, an underage boy, under the influence of drugs which had been given to him secretly by X. (X's plan was to photograph the event and use it to blackmail D.) D was charged and convicted of indecent assault. He appealed on the ground that it was an excuse that his intoxication was involuntary and that he would not have committed the offence if sober.

The House of Lords, reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal who had surprisingly ruled in his favour, said that D was properly convicted since the effect of the alcohol was to disinhibit D rather than to prevent him from forming the *mens rea* for the assault. Although D would not have committed the assault if sober, he knew exactly what he was doing and intended to do it. There was no excuse known to the criminal law that D was unwittingly induced to commit an offence he would not have committed otherwise, by the deceitful stratagem of another.

So the first question which must always be asked in a question involving an intoxicated offender is:

'Was the effect of the intoxication to prevent D from forming *mens rea* or simply to remove D's inhibitions or otherwise inflame D's anger or desires?'

Only in the former case will it avail D to adduce evidence of intoxication.

#### **Activity 10.7**

**Read Wilson, Sections 9.11.A 'Intoxication: its effect on criminal liability' and 9.11.B 'Distinguishing voluntary and involuntary intoxication' and answer the following questions.** 

- **a. Do you agree with the decision in** *Kingston***? Now consider the next question.**
- **b. Adam, a placid man, does not drink alcohol. Cain is a practical joker. He secretly adds vodka to Adam's orange juice at a party to see what Adam is like when drunk. Adam, who is unused to alcohol, feels strange and starts to act in a silly fashion. Cain taunts him for being drunk. Adam is indignant, loses his temper and punches Cain. Is Adam guilty of assaulting Cain? Should he be?**

#### **10.4.1 Restrictions on the use of evidence of intoxication**

We have discovered that adducing evidence of intoxication is of use only if the crime charged requires proof of *mens rea* and the effect of the intoxication is to deprive the defendant of *mens rea*. If it does not, the defence will, if anything, be counterproductive, providing the prosecution with clear evidence of motivation.

An important qualification to this rule must be added; namely that if the intoxication is voluntary it cannot be used, **even for this purpose**, with respect to a substantial class of crimes of *mens rea*. These crimes are known as crimes of basic intent. A crime of basic intent, it will be remembered, refers to those crimes of *mens rea* where the definition of the offence requires no proof that D had any special or specific intent in doing what they did beyond performing the actions which form the *actus reus* of the crime (see Chapter 4). For example, the crime of arson requires proof that D intended to light the match used to start the fire. It does not require proof that D specifically intended to damage or destroy property by fire. D's foresight that this consequence might result from their action is enough.

**page 138**
By contrast, murder requires the defendant not merely to intend to do the act which results in the victim's death, but also intend the consequence thereof – death or serious injury, as the case may be. This subtle distinction was first drawn in *DPP* v *Beard* [1920] AC 479. While drunk, D raped a young girl, who died of suffocation as a result of him putting his hand over her mouth to prevent her screaming. D's conviction for murder was quashed and a verdict of manslaughter substituted. Lord Birkenhead explained the legal position as follows.

Under the law of England as it prevailed until early in the nineteenth century voluntary drunkenness was never an excuse for criminal misconduct; and indeed the classic authorities broadly assert that voluntary drunkenness must be considered rather an aggravation than a defence. This view was in terms based upon the principle that a man who by his own voluntary act debauches and destroys his will power shall be no better situated in regard to criminal acts than a sober man…[However] where a specific intent is an essential element in the offence, evidence of a state of drunkenness rendering the accused incapable of forming such an intent should be taken into consideration in order to determine whether he had in fact formed the intent necessary to constitute the particular crime. If he was so drunk that he was incapable of forming the intent required he could not be convicted of a crime which was committed only if the intent was proved...

In a charge of murder based upon intention to kill or to do grievous bodily harm, if the jury are satisfied that the accused was, by reason of his drunken condition, incapable of forming the intent to kill or to do grievous bodily harm...he cannot be convicted of murder. But nevertheless unlawful homicide has been committed by the accused, and consequently he is guilty of unlawful homicide without malice aforethought, and that is manslaughter.

Voluntary intoxication, therefore, can support the defendant's claim that they lacked *mens rea* for a specific intent crime, such as murder. It cannot be so used for crimes of basic intent such as manslaughter, as *Lipman* later confirmed, where it is no part of the prosecution's case to show that the defendant had anything specifically in mind when acting as they did.

#### **10.4.2 'Dutch courage' crimes**

One small qualification needs to be added to the principle that voluntary intoxication may be used to negate the *mens rea* for a crime of specific intent. This is that if the defendant becomes intoxicated in order to gain the courage to commit a specific intent crime, they will not be able to rely on that intoxication. Authority for this proposition is *A-G of Northern Ireland* v *Gallagher* [1963] AC 349. In this case D decided to kill his wife. Before killing her, and to give himself the courage to do so, he drank a bottle of whiskey. The House of Lords, affirming D's conviction for murder, held that so long as he harboured the intention to kill his wife prior to becoming intoxicated, this was enough. It was not necessary to prove that D had the necessary intention at the time of the actual killing.

##### **Activity 10.8**

**Go to Chapter 6 of this module guide. Insert** *Gallagher* **into the text at an appropriate place to give another exception, along with the supposed corpse cases, to the rule that** *mens rea* **and** *actus reus* **must coincide in point of time.**

#### **10.4.3 Voluntary and involuntary intoxication distinguished**

To summarise: intoxication can result from either drink or drugs. **Involuntary** intoxication can be used to negate the intention, foresight, knowledge or belief of all crimes which have this mental element. Voluntary intoxication cannot be used to negate the *mens rea* of all such crimes: it can be used only in respect of crimes of specific intent. The leading case of *Majewski* [1977] AC 443 characterises voluntary intoxication as:

the intoxication of a person by an intoxicant which he takes otherwise than properly for a medicinal purpose (and according to medical instruction), knowing that it is or may be an intoxicant.

**page 139**
##### **Activity 10.9**

**Learn the** *Majewski* **test by heart: it tells you most of what you need to know about the difference between voluntary and involuntary intoxication. The bit it does not tell you is dealt with below in relation to** *Hardie***.**

Involuntary intoxication may therefore result from:

- an intoxicant taken under medical supervision
- an intoxicant secretly administered to A without their knowledge (e.g. *Kingston)*
- an intoxicant voluntarily taken by A, who mistakes its properties. An example is where A takes what they think is a painkiller when in fact it is an intoxicant.

A further qualification was introduced in *Hardie* [1985] 1 WLR 64, in which D, having been jilted by G, his girlfriend, was advised by G to take some of her Valium to calm himself down. D later set fire to a wardrobe in G's flat. Giving evidence, D claimed that he did not remember starting the fire due to his intoxicated state but conceded that he must have started it as he was alone in the room at the time. Although the Valium was taken wittingly by D, the Court of Appeal quashed his conviction. In effect, the case was treated as one involving involuntary rather than voluntary intoxication, as there was no suggestion that the taking of Valium was a reckless course of conduct.

##### **Activity 10.10**

**Read Wilson, Section 9.11.A 'Intoxication: its effect on criminal liability' and answer the following question.**

**If Hardie, instead of setting fire to the wardrobe, had left the house and, driving home, had fallen asleep at the wheel, would this have been a case of voluntary or involuntary intoxication?**

### **10.5 Crimes of basic intent and specific intent contrasted**

There is no consistently applied test to separate crimes of basic and specific intent. However, the usual test used, which is consistent with the explanation given above at Section 10.4.1, is that a crime of basic intent is one which does not require the defendant to have intended the consequences of his action. It can be committed by recklessness. Accordingly, in *Majewski* it was no defence to a charge of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty, that D was oblivious to what he was doing when he attacked the officer in a public house due to the effects of drink and drugs. Assault is a crime of basic intent because it can be committed by recklessness. A crime of specific intent, by contrast, is a crime which requires the defendant to have a consequence in mind when acting. Murder is a crime of specific intent because the prosecution must prove D acted with the intention of killing, or causing grievous bodily harm. It cannot be committed by recklessness.

#### **Activity 10.11**

**Read Wilson, Section 9.11.C.2 'The rationale for restricting the exculpatory scope of voluntary intoxication' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. What is the rationale for not allowing evidence of intoxication to be used to negate** *mens rea* **in crimes of basic intent such as assault? Do you agree with it?**
- **b. Which crimes are crimes of specific intent?**
- **c. Which crimes are crimes of basic intent?**
- **d. Most crimes of specific intent have a basic intent crime of lesser gravity which can still be charged in cases of voluntary intoxication. What are the basic intent counterparts of murder, and s.18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861?**
- **e. Give an example of a specific intent crime which has no basic intent counterpart.**

**page 140**
#### **10.5.1 Intoxicated mistakes as to a defence**

Most criminal defences remain available to the defendant even if they are mistaken as to the facts. So, for example, a person who honestly believes they are about to be attacked may lawfully use reasonable force to defend themselves although the belief was entirely without foundation.

This does not apply where the mistake is induced by voluntary intoxication. By s.76(4)(b) of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, for the purpose of selfdefence, D may not rely on any mistaken belief attributable to intoxication that was voluntarily induced. In *O'Grady* [1987] QB 995, D killed his friend, V, with whom he had been drinking throughout the day believing, on waking up from sleep, that V was attacking him. The Court of Appeal ruled that, where a mistake either as to the need to use force in self-defence or the degree of force necessary to defend oneself is made due to voluntary intoxication, self-defence cannot be relied upon. D's conviction for manslaughter was upheld, and the following statement of principle was forthcoming.

We have come to the conclusion that where the jury are satisfied that the defendant was mistaken in his belief that any force or the force which he in fact used was necessary to defend himself and are further satisfied that the mistake was caused by voluntarily induced intoxication, the defence must fail. We do not consider that any distinction should be drawn on this aspect of the matter between offences involving what is called specific intent, such as murder, and offences of so called basic intent, such as manslaughter.

In *O'Connor* [1991] Crim LR 135, on similar facts, the Court of Appeal adopted this approach, holding that where a defendant, because of self-induced intoxication, formed a mistaken belief that the use of force was necessary to defend himself, a plea of self-defence failed even in relation to the specific intent crime of murder. Evidence of self-induced intoxication could be used to negate the *mens rea* for the crime but **not** to support the defence of self-defence. In the context of this defence, it appears that it is not necessary for the defendant to actually be intoxicated to be disentitled from relying on his mistaken belief. It is enough that the mistaken belief was attributable to voluntary intoxication, as where recent alcohol abuse has resulted in a temporary, short-term psychotic episode (*R* v *Taj* [2018] EWCA Crim 1743). In *R* v *Taj* the defendant's long-term alcohol abuse had led to a state of psychosis that caused him to mistakenly believe V was a terrorist who was about to kill him. The Court of Appeal ruled that s.76(4)(b) applied although the defendant was not intoxicated at the time. His mistaken belief was induced by a psychosis caused by alcohol abuse and so it was attributable to voluntary intoxication. Compare *R* v *Oye* [2013] EWCA Crim 1725.

##### **Illustration 10.2**

**Adam goes to sleep very intoxicated. He wakes up, still drunk, to see Eve standing over him with what appears to be a knife in her hand. It is in fact a cigarette. Adam throws a knife at Eve which kills her.**

**If Adam relies on self-defence, he cannot use his intoxication to substantiate his claim that he believed he was being attacked with a knife and so was defending himself. The jury will be told to ignore Adam's intoxication and consider only whether he would have made the mistake if sober.** 

**If, however, Adam claims that he only intended to frighten Eve away, he can use his intoxication to explain why, although he threw a knife at her, he had no lethal intent.**

##### **Activity 10.12**

**Now read Wilson, Section 9.11.D 'Intoxicated mistakes' and answer the following question.**

**Does it make sense that intoxicated beliefs may be taken into account for the purpose of (negating)** *mens rea* **but not for the purpose of raising a defence?**

**The defence of duress, similarly, cannot be relied upon if D, because of intoxication, mistakenly believes they are being coerced into committing a crime (***Graham* **[1982] 1 WLR 294).**

**No feedback provided.**

**page 141**
In one situation, and inconsistently with *O'Connor*, an intoxicated belief can be relied upon to support a defence. This is in relation to s.5(2)(a) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 which enacts that it is a lawful excuse to a charge of criminal damage that the defendant believed they would have the consent of the owner. In *Jaggard* v *Dickinson*  [1980] 3 All ER 716 D, stranded with no money after a night's drinking, went round to a friend's house and, having failed to rouse her, broke into the house believing she would have her friend's consent. Unfortunately she chose the wrong house. The Queen's Bench Division accepted D's defence of lawful excuse. Section 5(2)(a) required only that the belief in consent was honestly entertained. There was no requirement that the belief be reasonable. This case was considered to be of doubtful authority in *Magee* v *Crown Prosecution Service* [2014] EWHC 4089 (Admin). A was charged with failing to stop after an accident on a road, as required by s.170(1) and (2) of the Road Traffic Act 1988. D's defence was that he did not realise that he had had an accident. The Divisional court ruled that this did not afford a defence where, as here, D's lack of awareness was the result of his self-induced intoxication. The offence charged was not a crime of specific intent and so *DPP* v *Majewski* [1977] AC 443 applied.

##### **Activity 10.13**

**Read Wilson, Section 9.11.E 'Conclusion' and consider whether the present law relating to intoxication is acceptable and whether the Law Commission proposals for reform would improve the situation.**

**No feedback provided.**

We discussed earlier the need to have a template for answering problem questions and gave some examples. Here is an example of a past examination question, testing understanding of intoxication, and the method to be adopted in answering it.

#### **Sample examination question**

**Alison, Bertha, Charles and Desmond meet in a pub for a reunion. Alison does not drink alcohol but Bertha puts vodka in her lemonade for a joke, without Alison noticing. Later Bertha suggests to Alison that Alison should drop her glass on the floor to see if it will bounce. Alison does so and the glass breaks. Bertha, who has been drinking beer all evening, later rides off on the landlord's bicycle. When stopped by John, a police officer, Bertha says that she thought the bicycle had been abandoned. When John tries to arrest her, Bertha aims a punch at him which misses and hits Phoebe, a bystander. What offences have been committed and by whom?**

**page 142**
#### **Advice on answering the question**

There are a number of possible offences committed here. In each case begin with the offence to be charged.

##### **Alison: method**

**Identify harm/crime = criminal damage**

- 1. Define the crime and identify the elements.
- 2. Then consider what elements are at issue.
- 3. Here there is only one issue. Has Alison *mens rea*? Her problem is that if we don't take into account her drunken state, the jury will inevitably conclude that she has, because everybody knows glasses don't bounce: they break. If we do take intoxication into account, she has a chance. How can Alison use the evidence to support her claim of lack of *mens rea*? By claiming that, due to her intoxicated state, 'I honestly did not think the glass would break.'
- 4. State the governing rules. If the intoxication is involuntary, Alison can use it. If it is voluntary she cannot, if criminal damage is a basic intent crime.
- 5. Discuss whether criminal damage is a crime of specific or basic intent.
- 6. Discuss whether Alison's is a case of voluntary or involuntary intoxication.
- 7. Conclude.

##### **Bertha: method**

**Identify harm/crime = punch = assault**

- 1. Define the crime and identify the elements.
- 2. Then consider what elements are at issue.
- 3. Again, the issue is whether Bertha lacks *mens rea.*
- 4. Only if she does lack *mens rea* can Bertha use evidence of intoxication to support her claim.
- 5. State the relevant rules. If the intoxication is voluntary it can be raised in evidence to negate *mens rea* for a crime of specific intent but not for a crime of basic intent.
- 6. Discuss whether it is a crime of specific or basic intent.
- 7. Discuss whether it is voluntary or involuntary intoxication.
- 8. Conclude. Bertha will not be able to rely on intoxication with regard to the punch since
  - i. she has the *mens rea* for assault, and
  - ii. even if she lacked the *mens rea* for assault, the intoxication is voluntary and assault is a basic intent crime.

 **Identify harm/crime = theft**

- 1. Use same method as above.
- 2. Conclude. Bertha will be able to rely on her voluntary intoxication on the theft charge as she does not have the *mens rea* for theft and theft is a specific intent crime.

**page 143**
### Am I ready to move on?**

Are you ready to move on to the next chapter? You are if – without referring to the module guide or Wilson – you can answer the following questions.

- 1. State what automatism and insanity have in common.
- 2. State how they differ.
- 3. State the test which differentiates insanity and automatism.
- 4. Decide whether the following conditions or events affecting *mens rea* are examples of insanity or automatism.
  - a. post-traumatic stress syndrome
  - b. heart attack
  - c. sleepwalking
  - d. depression
  - e. brain tumour
  - f. diabetic hypoglycaemia
  - g. diabetic hyperglycaemia
  - h. carbon monoxide poisoning
  - i. anaesthetic
  - j. hypnosis.
- 5. Explain the relevance of intoxication to proof of *mens rea* and to the defence of automatism.
- 6. Explain the difference between basic and specific intent crimes.
- 7. Explain what the relevance of 'involuntary intoxication' is to criminal liability.
- 8. Explain why theft is an example of a specific intent crime.
