## Mini lecture 1 - Mens Rea – Proving Fault

Prof William Wilson, Criminal law

Proving fault, the role played by judge and jury. All the offenses we're dealing with this year require the prosecution to prove that the accused was at fault, that is, was blameworthy in what he did or did not do. The fault required varies according to the offense. What makes a person blameworthy? There are two leading approaches, the subjective and the objective approach.

Subjective fault refers to a state of the defendant's mind at the time of doing the wrongful Act. The prosecution have to prove that the defendant had that state of mind at the time of acting. To gain a murder conviction or conviction for theft or criminal damage, it must prove that the accused had something in mind at the time he did the wrongful act.

We call it subjective fault because they themselves, the subject knew what they were doing and still did it. Take a look at some examples of crimes of subjective fault, intention, recklessness, knowledge, and belief are all states of mind. The prosecution needs to prove that this state of mind existed at the time of acting to gain a conviction for these crimes, these crimes of subjective fault.

What about objective fault? A person is objectively at fault, if irrespective of what he thought he was doing or had in mind, his conduct does not satisfy the standards of ordinary people. The standards, in other words, are objective, not subjective. Here are some examples of crimes of objective fault. These crimes do not require the prosecution to prove that the accused had any particular state of mind at the time of acting. They need to prove only an objective state of affairs, carelessness, dangerousness, negligence, and unreasonableness.

How does the prosecution go about proving fault? This depends upon whether the type of fault the defendant is accused of is subjective or objective. Let's start by looking at a crime of objective fault, namely, dangerous driving. As in all cases, the prosecution must prove the elements of the offense by reference to all the evidence. This is the evidence you should be hunting for when you answer a problem question.

Take a look at this case study on objective fault. Adam, a learner driver is arrested following an accident in which he lost control of the car, mounted the pavement, and crashed into a wall. This is a case study based on a real case called McCrone v Riding. In this case study, the judge will direct the jury something like this. "Members of the jury, you should convict if you think defendant's manner of driving was dangerous in the sense it fell far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver to whom it would have been obvious given the surrounding circumstances, that it provoked a serious risk of damage to person or property."

Notice, Adam is objectively at fault because he's driving was objectively dangerous, but he was not subjectively at fault because, from his point of view, he was probably doing his best. The court ignores the absence of subjective fault for crimes like dangerous driving and other crimes of objective fault. The jury will make its decision on the basis of what the prosecution have been able to prove about the surrounding circumstances. This will include the speed he was traveling, the road conditions, the number of pedestrians in the vicinity. The presence or otherwise of other vehicles, time of day or night and so on.

These are objective facts but the important fact to notice is that their assessment of whether the fault element has been established or not, does not take account of whether Adam knew of the risks or thought he was doing dangerously or indeed whether he could be expected to do any better. He was a learner after all. Whether someone is driving dangerously or not, is an objective fact which the jury as ordinary people can judge for themselves.

Let's turn now to subjective fault. The two forms of subjective fault we're most concerned with this year are intention and recklessness. The task of the prosecution is very different, and very much harder when it is faced with proving one of these types of fault. This is because as a form of subjective fault, it is likely that the accused will simply deny having the relevant mental attitude at the time of committing the wrongdoing. He will deny that he intended to do what he did. He will deny that he foresaw what he was doing might cause harm.

If Adam, in the dangerous driving example, was also charged with criminal damage to the wall, a crime of subjective fault, the prosecution would have a job on its hands to prove that Adam either intended or foresaw damage to the wall if he denies it.

Take a look at this case study on subjective fault. Is Adam guilty of murder? The answer, of course, is that we don't know. We need to know what Adam was thinking at the time and he will deny intending to kill Eve. If Adam were charged with gross negligence manslaughter by contrast, that's a crime of objective fault, the jury would no doubt convict because it does not need to know what Adam was thinking. All it has to decide is whether his behavior is grossly negligent, and, of course, objectively, firing a gun in the direction of someone close by is grossly negligent.

What if he's charged with murder? How does the prosecution prove that Adam had it in mind to kill Eve? A typical response of a defendant in Adam's situation will find him saying that he intended no harm to Eve rather he intended to frighten her. If the prosecution cannot disprove this claim, then Adam must be acquitted of murder, because what he did was consistent with frightening Eve, just as much as it is consistent with wanting to kill her. We need to look inside Adam's mind to know what he really intended.

How can the prosecution do this? It will need to convince the jury that there is no better explanation than that Adam wanted to kill Eve. It will do so by reference to the evidence, and it is the prosecution's task to put this evidence before the court.

On the next slide, some of the important questions which counsel for the defense and for the prosecution will put to Adam and any witnesses to supply this evidence. Here are some of the questions council ask in trying to establish what Adam had in mind when doing the shooting.

First, have you ever shot at a trespasser before? This is a key question. If Adam has done so without a dead body resulting, it suggests that he may be telling the truth when he says his intention was to frighten. Second, what experience do you have of firearms? Third, how good a marksman are you? Fourth, what caliber of gun is it and what make? Question four together with question two and three is important because the better the quality of gun and the better the marksman, the more likely it is that the killing was aimed at rather than an unlucky fluke.

Continuing. Question five, how far away was the deceased when you pull the trigger? Again, the answer to this question might be important. The nearer she was, the more likely it is that he was aiming to hit her rather than simply frighten her. Six, did you think you might hit her? Seven, did you shout any warning? If so, this would support Adam's case. Eight, for how long did you take aim before firing? If he shot without taking careful aim, this supports this case. Depending upon the answers to these questions, which will of course be tested in cross-examination, with witnesses giving evidence in support of and against Adams's account, the judge will direct the jury.

The following page is an example of a direction given on the basis of a set of findings, which suggest the killing was an unlucky accident. "Members of the jury, you may convicted of murder if you're sure that the accused shot the deceased intending to kill her. If you're not sure of this, then you may still find the accused guilty if you're sure he intended to cause her serious injury. If you are not sure that he had either of these intentions, you should bring in a verdict of manslaughter.

Now, the prosecution's case is that he was angry, at the heat of the moment aimed it and fired for the purpose of killing Eve. The accused case is that he did not take aim, and that his intention was only to frighten the deceased. In support of that contention, he claimed that he is an inexperienced marksman, his gun is very old and unreliable, and that the deceased was almost a kilometer away when he pulled the trigger. You've had some witnesses who corroborate these last three contentions. Now go away to consider your verdict."

This case study is a cut down version of a past examination paper with all the evidence taken out. Here's the question itself with the evidence put back in. Take a look at it. You'll notice that the objective facts support and acquittal but the subjective facts do not. Adam was not being entirely truthful when he said that his intention was only to frighten. If you'd heard the full story, what verdict would you reach?

## Introduction

As we saw in Topic 3, criminal guilt, at least for traditional core crimes, requires both wrongdoing and fault. It is not a crime to kill someone; but it is a crime to intentionally or recklessly kill someone.

Criminal fault is necessary to ensure that conviction and punishment are deserved. It acts as the criminal law's filtering mechanism to ensure that only the blameworthy are punished. Criminal fault is of two types - objective fault and subjective fault.

## 5.1 Objective fault

A person is objectively at fault if they are thought blameworthy, irrespective of their state of mind at the time of acting. For example, if my son is playing football too near to the house and breaks a window, I will be tempted to tell him off, even if the breakage was not deliberate and he was oblivious to the likelihood of causing damage. I will tell him that he is at fault because he failed to conform to the Wilson family's standards of carefulness. These are objective standards, which do not vary with the context, and take no account of the intentions or beliefs of the wrongdoer. Negligence or carelessness are two fault terms representing 'objective fault' and are the attributes of a person who fails to conform to the standards of ordinary, reasonable people.

Examples of crimes of objective fault are careless driving, dangerous driving and gross negligence manslaughter.

Many commentators feel that objective fault should have little or no place in criminal law. This is because of the importance of desert in punishment. Although we may rightly criticise people who fail to live up to the standards of behaviour we expect from ordinary, reasonable people, is it fair to punish them if they were doing their incompetent best? In McCrone v Riding [1938] 1 All ER 157, for example, the court ruled that it was no answer to a charge of careless driving that the driver was a learner driver and was not able to drive as proficiently as those who had passed their test.

In his book Punishment and responsibility (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968), H.L.A Hart, while accepting that punishment is deserved for failing to conform to objective standards of behaviour, nevertheless argued that punishment should be limited to those who could have conformed had they put their mind to it:

What is crucial is that those whom we punish should have had, when they acted, the normal capacities, physical and mental, for doing what the law requires and abstaining from what it forbids, and a fair opportunity to exercise these capacities.

## 5.2 Subjective fault

Traditional core crimes are, with the exception of rape and gross negligence manslaughter, crimes of subjective fault. Most of these crimes carry substantial terms of imprisonment as maximum sentences. Citizens are protected against unfair punishment by a general requirement that, when performing their act of wrongdoing, they have an accompanying mental attitude to what they are doing. It is this mental element which makes them blameworthy and so punishable. Put simply, desert in punishment requires the defendant to be conscious of the wrong they are about

to perform. There is no such requirement in relation to objective fault, where the defendant is at fault simply because they did something bad or stupid, not because they consciously chose to do so.

These (subjective) mental attitudes differ, depending on the offence.

- For murder, the prosecution must prove an intention to kill or cause serious injury.  $\bullet$
- For theft, the prosecution must prove that the defendant had the intention to deprive someone of their  $\bullet$ property.
- For criminal damage, the prosecution must prove that the damage was done **intentionally or recklessly**  $\bullet$ (with foresight).
- For handling stolen goods, the prosecution must prove that the handler knew or believed that the goods  $\bullet$ were stolen.

I think you will probably agree that for serious crimes such as these it would be unfair to punish someone for what they did unless they did so with one of these states of mind. It would be unfair to punish someone for handling stolen goods, for example, if they bought goods not knowing them to be stolen. In this topic, we will examine the meaning of two forms of subjective fault (mens rea) – intention and recklessness – and the major form of objective fault – negligence.

## Mini lecture 2 - INTENTION IN THE CRIMINAL LAW

Prof William Wilson

This mini-lecture considers the meaning of intention in the criminal law. Some crimes have intention as their sole fold element. Murder is an example. The prosecution must prove that the accused intended a particular consequence, the case of murder, death, or grievous bodily harm. No other mental attitude will do, so it is important that we know exactly what mental state intention describes. It would be wrong, for example, to convict someone of murder if they killed only recklessly or negligently. This might be manslaughter but it isn't murder.

What is it to intend a consequence? The law commission have defined intention as we use it in everyday speech. A person is to be regarded as acting intentionally with respect to a result when he or she acts in order to bring it about. In other words, we intend a consequence if we want it to happen or if it is our purpose or objective. We call this everyday meaning of intention, direct intention. Anthony Duff describes direct intention in another way. "A intends a consequence if he would consider his action a failure if the consequence did not occur as a result of his action." Take a look at this illustration and consider whether Adam directly intends to kill Eve.

To gain a conviction for murder against Adam, the prosecution must prove that Adam shot Eve in order to kill her. Did he? Of course, he did. Adam would've considered his action of failure if Eve had survived the gunshot, so Adam directly intends to kill Eve. Notice that the intention is present, although Adam was acting with the best of motives.

This distinction between intention and motive is very important. It is a person's intention that counts in the criminal law, not their motive. Good motives do not prevent a person from forming a criminal intention. Certain good motives may, however, provide the defendant with a defense.

Take a look at the case on the slide. Adam sees Eve about to shoot him. He pulls a gun from his pocket and shoots Eve dead. In this case, Adam intends to kill Eve. His good motive does not prevent that. However, he will not be guilty of murder because he has a defense, self-defense. Sometimes, however, this everyday meaning of intention lacks the focus necessary to do criminal justice.

Take a look at this case. If the standard meaning of intention were used at trial, Adam would escape liability for murder because he did not explode the bomb in order to kill Eve. He did it in order to defraud the insurance company. I think you'll agree, however, that it would be unjust for Adam not to be convicted of murder in this case.

In rare cases such as this, the jury are provided with a different definition of intention. This permits the jury to find a consequence intended even though the defendant did not act for the purpose of bringing it about. This form of intention is known as indirect intention. The judge will direct the jury that they are permitted to find a consequence intended if they are sure, the consequence was certain to occur if things went according to plan and the defendant knew this. In the above case, the jury can convict Adam of murder if, as they will be, they are convinced that although death was not his purpose, he nevertheless knew it was certain if things went according to plan. Adam is treated as intending the whole package.

Here's a summary. A jury is entitled to find that A intended a consequence if, one, it was his objective, aim, or desire, or two, although it was not his objective, it was, a) for all intents and purposes certain to occur as a result of A's action, and b) A knew this.

It is important to understand that it is only if the consequence is understood to be effectively certain that the defendant will be held to have indirectly intended it. Anything less than certainty is not enough.

In *Maloney* overruling *Hyam*, the House of Lords said that acting in the knowledge that one's action is very likely to result in the victim's death is not the same as intending that death. This is recklessness, not intention. As happened in the case of *Hyam*, a person who throws a fire bomb into a house intending to scare the inhabitants into leaving does not intend to kill them, unless the odds of them escaping are effectively zero. For example, because their baby is in arms or locked in a room. Of course, if the purpose of throwing the fire bomb was to kill, not scare, then there is direct intention, whatever the degree of risk involved.

Let's have a quick look at the respective roles of judge and jury. First, the vast majority of cases, the judge should ask the jury simply, did A intend, the consequence or not? In a very small minority of cases, for example, *Hyam*, they will need further guidance. They should be told that they may still find the consequence intended, although it was not the purpose of A's action. If they think it was virtually certain to occur as a result of A's action and A knew this, they should be told that foresight to a lesser degree of probability than certainty is not enough. This may be recklessness but it isn't intention.

Finally, the jury are left with the final decision on intention. Notice that the jury has some wriggle room in such cases. The jury ought to be told that they may find intention where the accused foresaw the consequences certain, not that they must.

When might wriggle room be useful? Take a look at this case. Adam and Eve go climbing together in the mountains. While climbing a steep cliff, for which they're roped together, Eve slips and starts to fall. The weight of Eve's body begins to drag Adam off the cliff. Adam, therefore, cuts the rope, causing Eve to fall to her death. Adam is charged with murder.

If Adam is charged with murder, the prosecution must prove that Adam intended to kill Eve by cutting her rope. Clearly, he did not act with the purpose of killing Eve, so he did not directly intend it. If Adam is to be found guilty, it will be because the jury find that he intended her death indirectly because of his knowledge that this consequence was certain if he cut the rope. The special direction, however, tells the jury that they're permitted to find Eve death intended. It does not tell them that they have to. The direction tells them that the decision is theirs and they should make their decision having weighed all the evidence including, of course, the context within which Adam cuts the rope.

If I were a jury member in this case, I would be pleased to have this wriggle room because it would allow me to find Adam not guilty on the basis that he did not intend to kill Eve either directly or indirectly. What do you think?

Look at these two scenarios and ask yourself which jury direction the judge should give to the jury in each case, the standard direction or the special direction? Stop the recording, look at the illustrations, and return to the recording when you've done so. When you've done that, pretend you are on the jury and decide whether in each case Adam intends to kill Eve.

The solution. In Case 1, there is clear evidence that Adam did not set the house alight for the purpose of harming Eve. This is a case where the special direction is appropriate.

In Case 2, there is clear evidence that Adam may have shot the rifle in order to kill Eve. This is a case where the standard direction should be given.

Now, what about your verdict in these two cases? Let me tell you what my verdict would have been. In Case 1, assuming the special direction has been given, I would have found Adam not to have intended Eve death because he thought it only probable that she would die, not certain. The correct charge, therefore, is one of manslaughter.

In Case 2, assuming the standard direction had been given, I would have found Adam to have intended Eve death. Although he knew he was a bad shot, all the evidence points to the fact that he shot her in order to kill her. After all, he told her that this is what he'd do the last time he'd caught her trespassing.

## 5.3 Intention

Intention lies at the heart of criminal liability, since a basic element in all core crimes is that D intended to do the act which formed the substance of their wrongdoing. To be guilty of murder by shooting, for example, the prosecution must prove both that D intended to pull the trigger and that D intended to kill, or at least cause serious injury. It is important from the outset to understand that intention is different from motive. As a rule of thumb, the motive provides the actor's reason for forming the intention. Criminal liability, in theory, ignores motive.

### **Illustration 1**

- 1. A shoots B, a police officer, through the heart in order to escape arrest.
- 2. A (B's wife) gives B, who is suffering a painful terminal illness, a lethal dose of poison so that B can die without further suffering.

In both of these cases, A intends to kill B. The motive, good or bad, is ignored.

### 5.3.1 Basic and specific intent

Certain crimes can only be committed with intention as the fault element. These crimes are known as crimes of specific intent. A crime of specific intent is a crime for which the prosecution has to prove that D intended to bring about some state of affairs by doing what they did. An example of a state of mind labelled as 'specific intent' is the fault element of murder, which is the intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. The prosecution in a murder case must always prove that D acted with one of these two states of mind.

Crimes which do not require the prosecution to prove that the defendant intended to do anything other than perform the acts which they did perform are known as crimes of basic intent. Criminal damage is a crime of basic intent. The prosecution has to prove that D intended to light the match, throw the stone, fire the gun and so on. But it does not have to prove that D intended to damage the relevant property by that act. If D foresaw that what they were doing might have this consequence that is a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind to support the conviction.

### 5.3.2 Murder and manslaughter: what does 'intention' mean?

Because murder is a crime of specific intent, we need to know precisely what 'intention' in this context means in order to ensure that those who commit murder are successfully distinguished from those who commit manslaughter, where no such intention has to be shown. In Hyam v DPP [1975] AC 55, this proved a great

challenge to the House of Lords when considering whether Mrs Hyam was guilty of murder or manslaughter. Hyam had dropped a petrol bomb through the letterbox of her neighbour, Mrs Booth, late one night when Mrs Booth was asleep. She did so not to kill or cause serious injury to Mrs Booth but to frighten her out of the neighbourhood, since Hyam was in love with Mrs Booth's husband and wanted him for herself. Two of Mrs Booth's children died in the fire. Hyam argued that she did not intend to kill or cause serious injury to Mrs Booth or the children: her intention was to frighten Mrs Booth. This argument was unsuccessful and Hyam was convicted. The House of Lords upheld the conviction on the basis that since she acted in the knowledge that death or serious injury was likely she must be taken to have intended those consequences. This decision was heavily criticised, not least because it was inconsistent with s.8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967, which makes clear that what one intends to happen and what one simply foresees might happen are very different things. At most, if it can be shown that a person acted in the knowledge that a consequence will probably occur, this can be used as evidence that the consequence was intended/aimed at, but other evidence might, of course, point in the opposite direction. Section 8 states that the jury:

shall not be bound in law to infer that he intended or foresaw a result of his actions by reason only of its being a natural and probable consequence of those actions.

It should instead make the decision about whether D did have such an intention or foresight:

by reference to all the evidence, drawing such inferences from the evidence as appear proper in the circumstances.

Subsequent to this case, first in Moloney [1985] AC 905 and then in Hancock and Shankland [1986] AC 455, the House of Lords revisited the meaning of intention. These are cases on murder, but their conclusions hold good for all crimes of specific intent. In both cases, the House of Lords, overruling Hyam, stated that if it could be shown that D foresaw a consequence as probable or highly probable and yet carried on regardless, this was not the same as intending the consequence. However, if the evidence showed that D foresaw the consequence as virtually certain, the inference that D intended it might be 'irresistible'.

### **Illustration 2**

D rapes V, a four-year-old infant. D then throws V into a fast-flowing river in order to destroy any trace of his DNA. He knows that this will certainly, for all practical purposes, result in V's death, which it does.

D does not act for the purpose of killing, but the jury will nevertheless find it difficult, if not impossible, to conclude that D did not intend to kill V because he knew that this was inevitable and yet did nothing to stop it. If D did not intend the death of V, then why did he do what he did? He intended, in other words, the whole package.

In Nedrick [1986] 1 WLR 1025, on facts similar to Hyam, Lord Lane CJ put it this way:

Where a man realises that it is for all practical purposes inevitable that his actions will result in death or serious harm, the inference may be irresistible that he intended that result, however little he may have desired or wished it to happen.

However, the jury must decide whether the consequence was intended by reference to all the evidence, and not just the probability of the consequence occurring, in line with s.8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967. This approach was adopted by the House of Lords in the case of Woollin [1999] 1 AC 82, in which Nedrick was approved. Woollin threw his infant son across the room in a moment of fury, and the son's skull fractured and he died. Woollin was charged with murder. The prosecution accepted that Woollin did not act in order to kill or cause serious injury, but nevertheless argued that he intended at least serious injury. Woollin was convicted of murder. He appealed on the basis that the trial judge misdirected the jury on the meaning of intention.

The House of Lords made two very important points in this case. The first point is that in the vast majority of cases the jury should not be directed by the judge as to what intention means since it is an everyday word. The jury should be directed simply that it should find the defendant not quilty of murder unless it was sure he intended to kill or, if not to kill, then to cause grievous bodily harm (the simple direction). However, it must be explained to the jury that intention is not the same as motive.

The second point is that the jury should be given some guidance in those rare cases, such as in Woollin and in Illustration 2 above, where, although the evidence does not indicate a purpose to kill or cause grievous bodily harm it does indicate that the defendant was aware that death or grievous bodily harm might well occur. This is what the guidance in Woollin states, in the form of a model direction from which judges should not deviate:

Where the charge is murder and in the rare cases where the simple direction is not enough, the jury should be directed that they are not entitled to find the necessary intention, unless they feel sure that death or serious bodily harm was a virtual certainty (barring some unforeseen intervention) as a result of the defendant's actions and that the defendant appreciated that such was the case. The decision is one for the jury to be reached upon a consideration of all the evidence.

This direction makes clear that the foresight of virtual certainty is not intention in itself but only evidence from which the jury is entitled to infer intention, depending upon the rest of the evidence (see Matthews and Alleyne [2003] EWCA Crim 192). This is known as indirect intention, in contrast with the standard form, which is known as direct intention. For example, in Illustration 2 above, the jury would no doubt wish to find the death of V (indirectly) intended.

But it would be less inclined to find indirect intention in Illustration 3, where D would also foresee death as a virtual certainty.

### **Illustration 3**

Adam is in hospital on a life support machine. Doctors have concluded that there is no prospect of recovery. Eve is admitted to the hospital following a car accident. Eve will die unless put on to a life support machine immediately, but there are none free due to the coronavirus pandemic. Cain, Eve's surgeon, removes the life support machine from Adam, and gives it to Eve. Cain knows that the inevitable result of this will be Adam's death. Does Cain intend to kill Adam?

The Woollin direction tells the jury that it is entitled to say 'yes' because Cain foresees his death as a virtual certainty but still goes ahead with the removal. However, the jury must make its decision on the basis of all the evidence, as required by s.8 Criminal Justice Act 1967. In other words, the jury is also entitled to say 'no' if the evidence as a whole supports that conclusion.

### **Study task 1**

Read Illustration 3. In the unlikely event that Cain is charged with murder, pretend you are a member of the jury. What decision would you reach as to whether Cain intended to kill Adam or not. Remember you must make your decision on the basis of all the evidence. This includes Cain's knowledge that the consequence of his action will be Adams death and also his knowledge that if he does not do so the consequence will be Eve's death.

Hint: there are no right or wrong answers. It's the jury's (i.e. your) call!

The Woollin direction is important for giving the jury some discretion (or elbow room) not to find intention in cases where death occurs as an inevitable side effect of an action otherwise quite acceptable, such as this. This is a surprising state of affairs, because motive is not supposed to be taken into account in deciding whether intention is present or not.

The Woollin direction is most important for drawing a clear line between intention and recklessness. As a matter of definition, foresight of anything less than virtual certainty is not intention but can be recklessness. But remember, as a matter of evidence rather than legal definition, where it can be shown that D acted in the knowledge that V's death would very likely (not certainly) occur if he went ahead as planned, the prosecution may try to persuade the jury, if the rest of the evidence supports this, that D carried on regardless with this knowledge not simply because he was reckless but because, contrary to what he claims, he actually intended (directly) to cause V's death.

A succinct restatement of the present state of the law as to the meaning of intention and the guidance juries are to be given appears in a Law Commission Report:

(1) A person is taken to intend a result if he or she acts in order to bring it about.

(2) In cases where the judge believes that justice will not be done unless an expanded understanding of intention is given, the jury should be directed as follows: an intention to bring about a result may be found if it is shown that the defendant thought that the result was a virtually certain consequence of his action.

(LC 304: Murder, manslaughter and infanticide (2006), para.3.27)

Intention as understood by subpara. (1) above is commonly known as direct intention.

R.A. Duff (Intention, agency and criminal liability. (Oxford: Blackwell, 1990)) has explained direct intention as being the state of mind of someone who, when acting, would consider his act a failure if the consequence did not result. Intention as understood by subpara. (2) is commonly known as indirect or oblique intention. This definition and that of the Law Commission should be learned and understood. It is as good as it gets and you can use it to help you find your way through the sometimes confusing case law.

## Discussion activity 1

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 6.6.C 'The meaning of intention in the criminal law' and think about answers to the following questions:

- a. What is the difference between intention and motive?
- b. Why is motive not supposed to be relevant to a person's culpability?
- c. Have the courts always kept to this principle?
- d. Why do you think that courts sometimes take motive into account when they are not supposed to?
- e. In the case of Steane (1947), on what ground could Steane have been acquitted other than his lack of criminal intent?

## 5.4 Recklessness

The mental element known as recklessness has had an undistinguished judicial history. On numerous occasions, it has been used by judges interchangeably with negligence or gross negligence, especially in the field of manslaughter. In theory, these two fault elements are very different: recklessness is a subjective fault element requiring proof of 'awareness' or 'thought', whereas negligence is an objective fault element which does not. The traditional meaning of recklessness is the deliberate running of an unjustified risk of which D was aware.

### 5.4.1 Awareness of the risk is necessary

The first major authority for the requirement that D be conscious of the risk they are running was Cunningham [1957] 2 QB 396. In this case, D ripped a gas meter from the wall of a house in order to steal from it. Gas escaped from the exposed pipes and penetrated next door's house, affecting the occupants. D was charged and convicted of 'unlawfully and maliciously administering a noxious thing so as to endanger life', contrary to s.23 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 (OAPA 1861). His conviction was quashed on appeal, as the judge had misdirected the jury on the meaning of 'malicious', telling them it meant 'wicked'. The Court of Appeal stated the correct meaning was that propounded by Professor Kenny, who had said in his Outlines of the criminal law (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1911):

In any statutory definition of a crime, malice must be taken not in the old vague sense of wickedness in general but as requiring either (1) an actual intention to do the particular kind of harm that in fact was done; or (2) recklessness as to whether such harm should occur or not (i.e., the accused has foreseen that the particular kind of harm might be done and yet has gone on to take the risk of it). It is neither limited to nor does it indeed require any ill will towards 'the person injured.

This definition was adopted in Briggs (Note) [1977] 1 WLR 605, a case on criminal damage to a car caused by overenthusiastic wrenching of the door handle.

### 5.4.2 Being aware of a risk does not always require a conscious thought process

This definition is true for the few crimes of malice which still remain, of which the most important is malicious wounding, an offence under s.20 OAPA 1861. Professor Kenny talks of the defendant 'foreseeing' the risk of harm or damage. Perhaps a better phrase is 'being aware of', since it is quite possible to be aware of things which might happen without explicitly thinking about them (foreseeing them) at the time of acting - that's why we do not put our hands in fires and other heat sources. An illustration is Parker [1977] 1 WLR 600, in which the defendant, after a bad day at the office, slammed down the receiver on the cradle of a defective public telephone in frustration, which

broke the telephone. He was fined for the damage caused and he appealed. The Court of Appeal upheld the fine, saying that if D did not think about the risk of damage before he slammed down the telephone then 'he was, in effect, deliberately closing his mind to the obvious - the obvious being that damage in these circumstances was inevitable'.

The Court concluded (Lane LJ at p.604):

A man is reckless in the sense required when he carried [sic] out a deliberate act...closing his mind to the obvious fact that there is some risk of damage resulting from that act but nevertheless continuing in the performance of that act.

This statement applies to those who know what the risks are but 'close their mind to the obvious'.

But what about those, such as the young and those with learning difficulties, who do not or would not know the risks in the first place? Are they reckless? In Stephenson [1979] QB 695, the defendant was a vagrant who lit a fire to keep warm in a haystack. The haystack was destroyed and he was charged and convicted of criminal damage. However, D had a long history of schizophrenia, and expert evidence at trial suggested that he may not have had the same ability to foresee or appreciate risks as the mentally normal person. The trial judge told the jury that it could convict if D closed his mind to the obvious fact that the haystack could be destroyed. Then the judge said, 'all kinds of reasons which make a man close his mind to the obvious fact – among them may be schizophrenia, that he is a schizophrenic'. The jury convicted and D appealed. To find out how the Court of Appeal decided the appeal, complete Study Task 2.

#### **Study task 2**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 6.7.A.1 'The subjectivist stance'.

- a. What was the Court of Appeal's response to the appeal in Stephenson?
- b. 'Closing the mind' to a risk is obviously a metaphor. But what does it actually mean?

Show feedback

- a. It quashed the conviction.
- b. I honestly don't know. It probably means that the risk was so obvious that the defendant, who was an ordinary person, must have known about it whether or not he actually thought about it. It is a very sloppy piece of analysis.

Apart from the 'closing the mind' type of recklessness, one further qualification needs to be made with respect to the requirement that the prosecution must prove conscious foresight. That is if the lack of awareness is due to voluntary intoxication. In Brady [2006] EWCA Crim 2413, D was drunk when he climbed on railings at a nightclub and fell on to the dance floor below, causing serious injuries to V, who was dancing there. He was charged with malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm, an offence under s.20 OAPA 1861.

Directing the jury as to recklessness, the judge said:

...where there is no issue of intoxication the test requires that the defendant should be aware of a risk and go on to take it, the risk being of injury.

He then directed the jury on recklessness in the context of voluntary intoxication, saying:

...if the defendant had been sober and in good mental shape would he have realised that some injury...might result from his actions in what he was doing in the condition he was in that night.

This was accepted as a correct statement of law by the Court of Appeal.

In short, a person is reckless if they are conscious that they were taking an unjustified risk, or were not aware of the risk only because they were intoxicated but would have been aware had they been sober.

### 5.4.3 The risk taken must be unreasonable in the circumstances known to the defendant

All of us take risks in our everyday lives. We run across roads, we climb trees. We play cricket, rugby, football and other dangerous sports. We drive cars. Taking risks is part of being a human being: it is not necessarily blameworthy behaviour. Risk-taking is blameworthy, therefore, only if it is a risk that should not have been taken. Lord Justice Lane in Stephenson explained the position as:

A man is reckless when he carries out the deliberate act appreciating that there is a risk that damage to property may result from his act. It is however not the taking of every risk which could properly be classed as reckless. The risk must be one which it is in all the circumstances unreasonable for him to take.

Whether the risk-taking is reasonable or not depends upon, in particular, the degree of risk involved, the type and amount of harm which will occur if the risk materialises, and the social utility of the risk-taking. Stated as a loose equation, the more likely and dangerous the risk taken is, the greater the social utility of taking the risk must be to offset it. A person who drives their car at 90 kmph in a 60 kmph zone may well be driving recklessly if they do so because they are late home for dinner. However, a jury may take a different view if the person drives so fast

because their daughter's appendix has burst, she is bleeding to death and they are taking her to hospital. The risk here is arguably offset by the social utility of the risk-taking. To help you decide these matters for yourself, ask yourself honestly: 'Is this a risk that I might have taken myself in the circumstances?'

#### **Study task 3**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 6.7.A 'Recklessness in the criminal law'

- a. A finds her car in the car park pinned by the car on either side. She can only enter her car by opening her car door and squeezing inside. She considers whether this creates a risk of denting the neighbouring car and concludes that so long as she is particularly careful when entering the car any damage will be avoided. She is wrong and the car is dented. Is she reckless for the purpose of the crime of criminal damage?
- b. Using key words, explain your reasoning in a maximum of 10 words
- c. Who decides, judge or jury?

### 5.4.4 Objective form of recklessness

For a short period at the end of the last century, recklessness took on an objective meaning. No longer was it necessary to prove that D foresaw the risk of harm accompanying their action; it was enough that they should have foreseen it. This was the consequence of the case of Caldwell [1982] AC 341.

In this case, the defendant had set fire to a hotel while drunk and was charged with reckless arson. He argued that he was so drunk he was unaware of his actions and the likely consequences. This was the kind of argument which had succeeded in Stephenson, except here the reason for D's lack of awareness was drunkenness, whereas in Stephenson it was his general mental capacity. D was convicted at first instance on the basis of the trial judge directing the jury that his lack of awareness could not be relied upon if it was due to self-induced intoxication (see Brady above). The Court of Appeal agreed.

The House of Lords dismissed the subsequent appeal but gave a different reason: namely, that whether or not D was intoxicated, it was not in any event a negation of fault that a person did not think that what they were doing was dangerous, when reasonable people would have done so. Far from it; such a failure to think manifested fault. Lord Diplock gave the following model direction for judges to give to juries in explaining the notion of recklessness. A person is reckless for the purpose of criminal damage if:

(1) he does an act which in fact creates an obvious risk that property will be destroyed or damaged and

(2) when he does that act he either has not given any thought to the possibility of there being such risk or has recognised that there was some risk involved and has nonetheless gone on to do it.

The key thing about this direction is that it tells the jury that it can convict of a crime of recklessness (such as criminal damage) although D gave no thought to the risk of damage, so long as the risk was obvious; in other words, as long as the reasonable person would have recognised the risk. This definition became the standard definition for all crimes of recklessness, except for crimes of violence such as assault and malicious wounding which, confusingly, continued to require actual awareness of the dangers of causing harm on the part of the defendant (Spratt [1990] 1 WLR 1073).

#### **Study task 4**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 6.7.A.2 'Caldwell recklessness' and consider the answers to the following questions:

- a. What were the major problems posed by Lord Diplock's new test of recklessness? Is the test simply a way of incorporating the 'closed mind' form of recklessness into the definition while ridding it of its ambiguity?
- b. Do you think that the House of Lords went too far in requiring the defendant to be aware of the risk they are taking if they are to be considered recklessness?

Show feedback

- a. It blurred the distinction between recklessness and negligence. It also made no allowance for people like Mr Stephenson and the girl in Elliot v C, who lacked the intellectual capacity to appreciate the dangers of what they were doing.
- b. If it is a way of 'incorporating the "closed mind" form of recklessness into the definition while ridding it of its ambiguity' it is an unnecessarily blunt way. If he had meant to do this Lord Diplock could easily have defined recklessness as 'knowingly taking an unjustified risk of causing harm' and then define 'knowingly' as meaning either that the defendant was conscious of this at the time or that they would have been if they had thought about it. Such a definition would convict Mr Parker but acquit Mr Stephenson.

In G and R [2003] UKHL 50, the House of Lords was faced with yet another case involving an unforeseen conflagration. The defendants were young boys of 11 and 12 who were away from home without permission. They set up camp in the backyard of a shop and, in the early hours of the morning, they lit a fire in a dustbin to keep

warm. The fire spread and the shop was gutted: the boys were charged with arson.

The House of Lords Z acknowledged that the Caldwell test of recklessness might operate unfairly for 11 and 12year-old boys if they were held to the same standard of foresight as reasonable adults. An obvious risk for the latter would not necessarily be obvious for the former. Their Lordships had three choices: to keep the law as it was; to modify it so as to render the test of recklessness sensitive to the characteristics of age, experience and mental capacity of the defendant; or to return the law to its pre-Caldwell state. They chose the final option and overruled Caldwell.

#### **Study task 5**

Here is part of a past examination question.

"D, who is thinking about other things, parks his car in a car park and, without checking to see if any other car is in the vicinity, opens his car door. V's car, which is close by, suffers a serious dent."

Now consider whether D is reckless, in which case he is guilty of criminal damage, or simply negligent, in which case he is guilty of nothing. Apply the law to the facts of this case and make your decision. Remember, there are two routes to concluding D is reckless.

a. Is D reckless?

b. Give reasons for your answer.

## 5.5 Negligence

It is important to be able to distinguish recklessness from negligence. As you know, the formal distinction is that recklessness, which is a form of subjective fault, requires awareness. Negligence, which is a form of objective fault, does not.

All cases of recklessness are automatically also cases of negligence. Recklessness is negligence with added fault, namely 'awareness' of the risk being run. However, not all cases of negligence are cases of recklessness, because negligence does not require proof of any awareness of the risk. The two fault elements start to fade into each other when we consider 'closed mind' recklessness, because here the fault element can be established without conscious awareness, so long as the risk was obvious. This can be seen in Study Task 5. Clearly, D was negligent, but he may also have been reckless if the jury concludes that the risk to the other car was so obvious that he must have closed his mind to it.

Negligence covers a far wider field of fault than recklessness, however, since it describes a person's conduct rather than their state of mind. There are a lot of ways a defendant's conduct may be found wanting, other than by them creating a danger consciously. The Law Commission's definition of negligence makes this clear. It occurs where a person 'fails to exercise such care, skill or foresight as a reasonable man in his situation would exercise' (Law Commission Working Paper No. 31: Codification of the criminal law, general principles, the mental element in crime  $(1970)\mathbf{Z}$ ).

### **Study task 6**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 6.9.B 'Negligence in the criminal law' and answer the following questions.

- a. Apply the Law Commission's definition to careless driving. Give examples of the three ways a driver can drive negligently.
- b. Which, if any, of these examples might lead to the jury to conclude that the defendant was also reckless?

Crimes of subjective fault are often graduated in terms of the degree of commitment shown to the result. This is why murder is treated more seriously than reckless manslaughter: because D's commitment to the outcome is greater than where D kills only recklessly. Negligence, as a form of objective fault, also forms part of a ladder of gravity. There may be degrees of negligence. At the top end, there is gross negligence, which is the fault element of gross negligence manslaughter. In order to secure a conviction for this offence, the prosecution must prove far

more than that D simply 'failed to exercise such care, skill or foresight as a reasonable man in his situation would exercise'. It must show the failure which led to the victim's death was of such a high degree that nothing but a manslaughter conviction would address it.

For other crimes, such as dangerous driving, 'extra' negligence beyond that necessary for careless driving is necessary. Careless driving becomes dangerous driving when a driver falls 'far below' the expected standard, and when such a failure brings obvious risks of danger (s.2A of the Road Traffic Act 1988).

Many other crimes have a negligence component. Until the passing of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, D would not be liable if he honestly believed the victim to be consenting (subjective fault). The new fault element is negligence (objective fault). D will escape liability for non-consensual intercourse only if his belief that V consented was based on reasonable grounds.

A negligence component may also be included in an otherwise strict liability offence by the incorporation of a nonegligence or 'due-diligence' defence. For example, by s.28 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, a person has a defence to the otherwise strict liability crime of possessing controlled drugs if they can prove that they neither believed nor suspected, nor had reason to suspect, that the substance or product in question was a controlled drug. Notice here that there is a reversal of the usual burden of proof. The defence, rather than the prosecution, has to do the proving. The apparent justification for this is that the offence is one of strict liability and therefore any escape from liability must be 'hard won'.

## Learning activity 2

 Complete the following sentences by dragging and dropping the correct word, phrase or case name into the ga

Criminal guilt requires both wrongdoing and ______. Most crimes are crimes of ______ fault. This means that the actual defendant must ______ the consequence or the risk of it occurring.

This can be compared with ______ fault; a person is objectively at fault if they are thought blameworthy, irrespective of their actual state of mind at the time of acting. Two forms of subjective fault are ______ and ______.

For the offence of murder, we need to know precisely what ‘intention’ means to distinguish those who commit murder from those who commit ______, where no such intention has to be shown. Intention can also encompass where the defendant has a purpose other than causing death but where death is the inevitable or likely consequence. In the case of ______ [1999], the House of Lords found that a jury may find the necessary intention if death or serious bodily harm was a ______ result of the defendant’s actions and that the defendant appreciated that this was the case.

______ is the deliberate running of an unjustified risk of which the defendant was aware. The case of ______ [1957] was the first major authority to apply a ______ test for recklessness, that the defendant must be conscious of the risk they were running. The case of ______ [1982] introduced an ______ test for recklessness. No longer was it necessary to prove that the defendant foresaw the risk of harm accompanying their action; it was enough that they ______ foreseen it. This was, however, overruled in ______ [2003] which removed the objective test for recklessness.

______ is a form of objective fault and has the attributes of a person who fails to conform to the standards of ordinary reasonable people. Examples of crimes of objective fault are careless driving, dangerous driving and ______.

## Sample examination question 1

**Question**
 Write a skeleton answer for the following question:

**Compare and contrast intention, recklessness and negligence.**

 **Tutor guidance**

Using the guidance below, think about how you would answer the question. When you are ready, read the feedback.

Your skeleton answer should include:

- definitions of all three fault elements (remember to highlight the two forms of intention)
- three points of similarity (compare) and three points of distinction (contrast) between intention (both forms) and recklessness
- three points of similarity (compare) and three points of distinction (contrast) between recklessness and negligence
- one point of similarity (compare) and four points of distinction (contrast) between intention and negligence.
- $+$  Feedback

 **Definitions**

Direct intention requires proof of purpose. Indirect intention requires proof of foresight of virtual certainty. Recklessness (now) means consciously running an unjustified risk of causing harm. Negligence requires running an unjustified risk of causing harm, whether consciously or not.

#### Similarities: intention and recklessness (compare)

- 1. Both are forms of subjective fault.
- 2. Both involve degrees of choice/commitment to the outcome.
- 3. Both Indirect intention and recklessness require foresight of the consequences

#### Distinctions: intention and recklessness (contrast)

- 1. Recklessness reflects lesser commitment to the outcome than intention.
- 2. A person can directly intend a consequence although it is unlikely to result. Not so indirect intention.

3. Indirect intention requires proof that A foresaw the consequence as virtually certain. Recklessness requires proof only of foresight of the substantial risk.

 Similarities: recklessness and negligence (compare)

- 1. Both recklessness and negligence require proof of risk taking.
- 2. Both Recklessness and negligence are negated if the risk-taking is justified. (Indirect intention is not (in theory at least).
- 3. Where a person is aware that he is acting dangerously he is both negligent and reckless as to the result

 Distinctions: recklessness and negligence (contrast)

- 1. Recklessness is a state of mind (foreseeing risk). Negligence is a way of behaving (acting in such a way as to create an unjustified risk of causing harm).
- 2. Recklessness involves subjective fault. Negligence involves objective fault.
- 3. Most non fatal offences against the person can be satisfied by proof of recklessness. No non fatal offences against the person offence can be committed by negligence.

 Similarities: negligence and intention (compare)

1. Both are forms of criminal fault

 Distinctions: negligence and intention (contrast)

- 1. Negligence, unlike intention, does not require any commitment to the harmful result.
- 2. Intention is a state of mind, not so negligence
- 3. Intention is a form of subjective fault. Negligence is objective fault.
- 4. In the absence of an affirmative defence, it is no answer to a crime of intention that the accused's act was justified.

## Exam question activity 1

Try to answer the following examination question:

Janet is a member of a group which campaigns against climate change. After learning that a conference venue in London is hosting a climate change conference, Janet decides that she will do a stunt to draw public attention to the issue. She places bombs in two different locations; near the entrance of the conference venue and at a pub just outside the conference venue. She phones both places to issue a warning. In the pub, the bomb explodes before everyone has left because an old man trips and blocks the exit. Three people are killed. At the conference venue, the bomb fails to explode at first but then goes off an hour later, killing an explosives expert who is attempting to defuse it. When interviewed by the police, Janet claims that she only planned to destroy property and that, by giving warnings, she believed she had taken the necessary precautions to ensure that no one was hurt.

Discuss whether Janet has the intent to kill. You can discuss the offence of murder, but you do not need to discuss manslaughter.

**Please note!** This activity is focused on intention. Intention often forms part of problem questions on murder and it is essential you understand and can apply this important concept. You should not move on from this topic until you can answer this question.

Feedback is available but try to answer on your own first. Your response will not match the feedback exactly but you should compare your performance with it and consider whether you took all the relevant factors into account.
