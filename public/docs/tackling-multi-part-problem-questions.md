# Tackling multi-part problem questions

Dr Laura Lammasniemi Criminal Law

## Learning Objectives

- How to tackle multipart problem questions / Part One of the exams
- Review a past exam question on the topic of offences against the person

## The importance of multi-part problem questions

- You will come across many different types of questions in your study and exam preparation for criminal law:
  - In exams, Part One is an unseen multipart problem question and Part Two consists of essays and variations of problem questions
- It is important to incorporate practicing different types of questions into your study of criminal law

## Introducing Part One past exam question

Lazim, a malicious joker, inflates a paper bag and explodes it behind Mary's back. The shock causes Mary to jump sideways and bang her head on a cupboard door, causing bruising.

Lazim then adds roughly ground glass to Zoe's face cream. When Zoe uses the face cream, she suffers abrasions to her cheeks which turn septic necessitating head bandages, cortisone injections and a course of antibiotics. Zoe is left with slight scarring to the cheeks.

When Moeen, a police officer, hears what Lazim has done he runs after Lazim to arrest him. Lazim hides in a doorway intending, when Moeen runs past, to stick out his foot and trip him. By mistake, he trips up Noor, a young girl running home after school, causing her to cut her leg.

(a) If you were a prosecutor, what would be your preferred charge in relation to Lazim and the matter of Mary and her bruised head?

(b) Give reasons for your choice in (a) including an explanation as to why you chose as you did rather than choosing a different charge.

(c) If you were Lazim's defence counsel, what arguments would you advance in response to the charge in (a)?

(d) If you were prosecuting counsel, what would be your preferred charge in relation to the harm caused by Lazim to Zoe?

(e) Give reasons for your choice in (d) including an explanation as to why you chose as you did rather than choosing a different charge.

(f) If you were Lazim's defence counsel, what arguments would you raise in answer to the charge raised in (d) above.

(g) If you were prosecuting counsel, how would you counter the arguments raised in?

(h) If you were prosecuting counsel, what would be your preferred charge against Lazim in the matter of Noor's injuries?

(i) Give reasons for your choice in (h) including an explanation as to why you chose as you did rather than choosing a different charge.

(j) If you were defence counsel, what arguments would you raise in response to the charge in (h) above?

(k) If you were prosecuting counsel, how would you respond to the arguments in (j) above?

## Structuring your answer

- a. If you were a prosecutor, what would be your preferred charge in relation to XXX? *Note: the answer here should be very brief, just identify the statutory or common law offence in question. No explanation or analysis needed.*
- a. Give reasons for your choice in (a) including an explanation as to why you chose as you did rather than choosing a different charge. *Note: This is analysis. This should be the longer answer; here you consider the actus reus and mens rea of the offence in question and with reference to supporting case law analyse whether the D has completed the actus reus and mens rea.*
- b. If you were a defence counsel, what arguments would you advance in response to the charge in (a)? *Note: Here you consider if the D had any potential defence? Did he potentially not meet one or more elements of the offence? Can you do anything to reduce his liability if no defences?*
- c. If you were prosecuting counsel, how would you counter the arguments raised in (c)? *Note: This is usually quite brief. Here your answer would entirely depend on what you said in (c) and you should attempt to directly respond to any defence or mitigation you put forward.*

## PAUSE: Part One past exam question

Here you can pause the video and attempt to answer the question before moving on:

Lazim, a malicious joker, inflates a paper bag and explodes it behind Mary's back. The shock causes Mary to jump sideways and bang her head on a cupboard door, causing bruising.

(a) If you were a prosecutor, what would be your preferred charge in relation to Lazim and the matter of Mary and her bruised head?

(b) Give reasons for your choice in (a) including an explanation as to why you chose as you did rather than choosing a different charge.

(c) If you were Lazim's defence counsel, what arguments would you advance in response to the charge in (a)?

## Answering Part One past exam question

**(a) If you were a prosecutor, what would be your preferred charge in relation to Lazim and the matter of Mary and her bruised head?** My preferred charge would be s.47 of Offences against the Person Act (OAPA) 1861.

**(b) Give reasons for your choice in (a) including an explanation as to why you chose as you did rather than choosing a different charge.**

Section 47 of OAPA 1861 consists of three elements: assault/battery, actual bodily harm (ABH) and causation. Firstly, Lazim committed battery as he recklessly applied unlawful force to Mary e.g. the bang to her head. As per *Haystead*, it doesn't matter the contact was not direct. Prosecution could also argue that assault was present. It is defined in *Venna* as 'intentionally or recklessly leading someone to apprehend the application to his body of immediate unlawful force'. Secondly, the injury Mary suffered constitutes ABH, defined Donovan [1934] as 'any hurt or injury that is ... more than merely transient and trifling.' The bang causes Mary to suffer bruising which following the case of Donovan constitutes ABH. Finally, there is need to show that the battery Lazim committed caused the ABH. This element too is satisfied as Mary has been caused harm but not serious harm. Case of *Roberts* confirms there is no additional mens rea element for the injury, so prosecution does not need to show foresight of injury, simply that be committed the assault that that caused the harm.

(c) **If you were Lazim's defence counsel, what arguments would you advance in response to the charge in (a)?**

If the prosecution argued that Lazim had committed the unlawful act of assault, I would argue that the elements were not met. An assault, as per Venna, requires an act leading someone to expect physical contact. Hearing a bang is not of that nature. Secondly, in any case, I would want to argue that the defence of consent applies. Lazim was a malicious joker and this implies he wanted to simply play around, and this would be an act of horseplay (as per cases of *Jones* and *Aitken*) and so he could rely on victim's consent.
