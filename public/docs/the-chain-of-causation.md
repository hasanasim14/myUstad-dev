# The Chain of Causation

Professor William Wilson

## Learning objectives

At the end of this lecture you should be able to

- Understand the meaning of a chain of causation and its importance in setting the limits of accountability for result crimes such as homicide
- Understand how a chain of causation can be broken by subsequent acts of the a third party or victim or a later abnormal event

## Causation

All result crimes require proof that A caused the result.

 So murder, manslaughter, crimes of violence, criminal damage require proof that the accused caused the relevant harm.

- Proving causation is not normally an issue at trial. The facts usually speak for themselves.
- It becomes an issue only when there is more than one straightforward cause

### Case studies

1. Adam and Eve are members of a hill walking society. They often go walking together in the hills. One day, on the top of a cliff, Adam tells Eve that he is going to kiss her. Eve, who has strong moral and religious principles, says "if you do, I shall jump off the cliff." Adam does not believe Eve, and kisses her. Eve then jumps off the cliff and is killed.

 Did Adam cause her death or did her jump break the chain of causation?

2. Adam shoots Eve leaving her wounded. On the way to hospital the ambulance is involved in an accident which leaves Eve and the ambulance crew dead.

 Did the accident break the chain of causation?

### How can the chain of causation be broken?

The courts task in these problem cases is to decide whether the causal sequence is intact or whether it has been broken by a subsequent act or event.

**Case study 1** Did Eve's jump break causal chain?
**Case study 2**

Did ambulance accident break causal chain?

### The chain of causation 1

The accused's acts need not be sole or even main cause of harm. The defendant cannot escape liability by claiming other causes contributed to the outcome.

*Police action was not an independent voluntary act but a foreseeable reaction to what the defendant had done*

Pagett (1983) CA Benge (1865)

The questions the jury must ask itself in deciding whether a chain of causation resulting in harm can be traced back to the defendant are as follows:

1. Did the defendant's act (or omission) contribute significantly to the result?

2. Was there any later act or event which was independent of that act (or omission) and was so potent as to render that act insignificant.

### The chain of causation 3

5. Since Jordan (1957) (Activity 4.1) medical interventions have not been adjudged to break the chain of causation even if very negligent since they are not independent of the accused's acts but are reactions to it and made necessary by it. In other words they are not extraordinary.

*"When the victim of a criminal attack is treated forâ€¦ injuries by medical staff, attempting to repair the harm done, it will be (rare) that such treatment could be regarded in law as the cause of the victim's death to the exclusion of the accused's acts"*

R v Cheshire (1991) CA

### Medical interventions breaking the chain of causation

- This does not mean that medical interventions cannot break the chain of causation. Rather it means that they normally will not.
- Medical interventions are not a special case and are still subject to the same principles as other third party reactions.
- Only later voluntary actions or abnormal events, which are independent of the initial attack and which are so potent as to cancel out the causal potential of that attack, break the chain of causation.

Here are some examples which **potentially** will break the causal chain:

- A. An earthquake which causes the hospital to collapse killing many doctors and patients, (abnormal event)
- B. A homicidal nurse/doctor gives V a lethal dose of a drug. (voluntary independent act of third party eg Rafferty)
- C. The victim becomes infected with a dangerous disease (eg hepatitis) while recovering from the attack (Kane 1915).
- D. Mistaken treatment which is not a normal response to the diagnosed condition and is clinically lethal for any person in the patient's condition, eg a negligent administration of a massive overdose of the prescribed palliative drug or a lethal dose of the wrong drug.
- E. Having recovered from the attack V falls down stairs in the hospital and breaks their neck.
