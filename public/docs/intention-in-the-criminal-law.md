Professor William Wilson

Criminal Law

## Learning objectives

After completing this topic, you should be able to:

- State and explain the definition of direct intention
- State and explain the definition of indirect intention
- Explain how a judge should direct the jury on intention in standard cases
- Explain how a judge should direct the jury on intention in non standard cases
- Explain and discuss the discretion given to the jury not to find a consequence intended although the accused knew for certain that his action would bring it about.

## Intention in the Criminl Law

Crimes of Intention include:

- Murder
- Wounding with intent (s.18 OAPA 1861)
- Criminal Attempts

## Intention and Motive

1. Direct Intention

- "(1) A person is to be regarded as acting intentionally with respect to a result when he or she acts in order to bring it about.' Law Commission.
- Adam's wife, Eve, is trapped in a car which is about to be engulfed by flames after an accident. She pleads with Adam, who has escaped the wreckage, to kill her before she is burnt to death. Adam does so by a gunshot through the heart.
- "A intends a consequence if he would consider his action a failure if the consequence did not occur as a result of his action? " (RA Duff)
- It is a person's intention that counts in the criminal law not his/her motive.
- Good motives do not prevent a person from forming a criminal intention.
- Adam sees Eve about to shoot him. He pulls a gun from his pocket and shoots Eve dead.

## Meaning of Intention

2. Indirect Intention

- Adam has signed a contract with Eve, the pilot of a cargo plane, to take some cargo to France. He places a bomb in the cargo timed to explode when the plane is in the air. He does this to obtain an insurance pay out. His plan works. The plane explodes destroying the cargo, and killing Eve.
- In the rare case where the simple direction in clause (1) is not enough, the jury should be directed that: they are not entitled to find the necessary intention with regard to a result unless they are sure that the result was a virtual certainty (barring some unforeseen intervention) as a result of the defendant's actions and that the defendant appreciated that such was the case.

## Summary
So a jury is entitled to find that A intended a consequence if:

- 1. It was his objective/aim/desire
- 2. Although it was not his objective, it was
  - a) for all intents and purposes certain to occur as a result of A's action, AND
  - b) A knew this

## Indirect (Oblique) Intention

- Acting in the knowledge that a consequence (eg death) is highly probable **IS NOT** enough to render the consequence (death) intended.
- *Hyam v DPP* (1975)
- *Moloney* (1985)

### **Judge and Jury**

- 1. In 99% of cases the jury should be asked simply 'did A intend the consquence or not?'
- 2. In 1% of cases, eg *Hyam*, they will need further guidance. They should be told that they can still find the consequence intended, although it was not the purpose of A's action. if they think it was virtually certain to occur as a result of A's action and A knew this. **Foresight to a lesser degree of probability than certainty is not enough.** This may be recklessness but not intention.
- 3. The jury are left with the final decision.

- Wriggle Room for the Jury
- Adam and Eve go climbing together in the mountains. While climbing a steep cliff, for which they are roped together, Eve slips and starts to fall. The weight of Eve's body begins to drag Adam off the cliff. Adam therefore cuts the rope, causing Eve to fall to her death. Adam is charged with murder.

## Test Yourself

- **Case 1**  Adam wants to defraud his insurance company. One night he sets his house alight. His house is occupied by Eve, his tenant. He realises she will very probably be killed in the blaze but does not care.
- **Case 2**  Adam sees Eve trespassing on his field about a kilometre away. She has done this many times. The last time he saw her Adam told Eve that if she did it again he would kill her. He takes out his rifle and aims it at her. He knows he is unlikely to hit her since the rifle has a range of only around a kilometre, it is not a very reliable rifle and he is not a very accurate shot. Adam hits Eve and she is killed.
 The solution

- **Case 1**  There is clear evidence that Adam did not set the house alight for the purpose of harming Eve. So this is a case where the **special direction** is appropriate.
- **Case 2** There is clear evidence that Adam may have shot the rifle in order to kill Eve. So this is a case where the standard direction should be given.
