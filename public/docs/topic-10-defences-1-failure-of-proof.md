Core text
• Wilson and Lammasniemi, Chapter 9 'Defences (1): introduction to defences and failure of proof'.

## Introduction

So far we have discovered that the prosecution bears the burden of proving that all the elements of the offence are present. It also bears the burden of disproving any defence for which D adduces evidence in support. In the next two topics, we shall examine the core general defences. These are of two types: failure of proof defences and affirmative defences.

## Mini lecture 1 - GENERAL DEFENCES 1

Prof William Wilson, Criminal law

This mini lecture provides a general introduction to the main criminal defenses and gives an outline of one form of defense, which are termed failure of proof defenses. We have seen that criminal offenses comprise two elements, actus reus and mens rea. If the prosecution can establish both the offense is committed, however, a person may still avoid punishment for the offense if they have a defense. Take a look at this diagram, you'll see the defenses take two forms.

The first is a failure of proof defense. Say, for example, if the defendant pleads insanity in answer to a charge of murder, she is claiming that the prosecution cannot establish, cannot prove fault necessary for murder, an insane intention is not an intention. The second type of defense is an affirmative defense. These are true defenses. They block criminal liability, although the accused is fully responsible for his action. The accused confesses to the actus reus and mens rea of the crime, but he asks to avoid liability because the context in which he was operating rendered his commission of the offense excusable or justifiable. Self-defense is an affirmative defense.

The defendant says, "Yes, I punched X," but it was justified as a means of protecting myself, X's attack. Other examples of affirmative defenses are duress and necessity. In this lecture, we shall concentrate on failure of proof defenses. Their function is to control the kind of evidence the defendant might wish to put before the court to discourage the jury reaching or what would otherwise be an open-and-shut case of guilt. Look at this case study, the question is, will the jury convict her for murder? Would you convict her?

In the absence of further evidence, the jury will obviously convict as the facts speak for themselves. People don't put babies on fires unless they want to kill them. Let's suppose the jury are told that the nurse was totally intoxicated at the time of throwing the baby on the fire.

In that case, they may well acquit of murder if it appears her condition caused her to mistake what she was doing so that she lacked mens rea. Defense of intoxication specifies the circumstances under which the defendant is permitted to adduce evidence of intoxication, to negate mens rea, and the consequences which will follow. These defenses are very important therefore because they enable the defendant to deflect a conviction where otherwise it would be inevitable.

Let's look first at intoxication. Intoxication is not a defense in itself. It is no defense to say, "I would not have committed the offense if sober," even that is if the intoxication was involuntary. However, for certain crimes such as murder, the fact of being intoxicated may be used as evidence that the intention to kill or to cause serious injury was not present. In such a case, the jury may convict of manslaughter. For crimes such as murder where a specific intention has to be established, evidence of intoxication may be used to negate this intention, but notice, for crimes of recklessness or negligence, pleading intoxication is worse than useless.

It proves the prosecution a case for it, is not then a good idea to raise intoxication in answer to a charge of dangerous driving. Can you think why? Let's turn now to insanity. A defendant can avoid responsibility for any crime if they were legally insane at the time of committing the offense. The burden of proving insanity is on the defendant for this defense. But what is insanity?

It's important to understand that what the law understands as insanity and what the medical profession understands as insanity is very different. To be legally insane, it is not enough that the defendant was suffering from mental illness at the time of committing the offense. She must suffer from a condition which prevented her from understanding even that she was committing an offense. So in our nurse and baby case, the nurse would only have the defense of insanity if her insanity was such that she did not know she was throwing a baby on the fire at the relevant time. This is a very high bar indeed.

Automatism. Automatism refers to the state where the defendant is not in conscious control of their body. It takes two forms. The first form is being unable to control one's bodily movements. Take a look at this example, A in this case will be able to rely on the defense of automatism since at the time of the offense he was unable to control his bodily movements.

The second form of automatism has much in common with insanity, both involve a defendant who is unconscious of what they're doing. It differs from insanity only insofar as the condition is triggered by an external cause. For example, concussion rather than as is the case of insanity, an internal condition of the defendant. Take a look at this example, D has a tooth removed by anaesthetic. On the way home, he causes a traffic accident as a result of being groggy from the effects of the anaesthetic. This is a case again where the defense of automatism arises because the defendant was not in conscious control of his action. Okay now please continue with your reading and activities on Topic 10.

## 10.1 The two types of defences

There are two categories of defences – affirmative defences and failure of proof defences. The former defences block criminal liability, even though D has performed the actus reus of the offence with mens rea. The essence of such defences is that D is not denying that the elements of the offence are present. Rather, D is seeking to excuse or justify what would otherwise be punishable conduct on the basis of the particular circumstances which led them to do what they did. For example, D may wish to adduce evidence that they robbed a bank under coercion by a third party, or that they were acting in self-defence to prevent V shooting them or another person, or that they had lost their self-control, having come upon V committing rape upon a child. Such defences are known as affirmative defences or defences of confession and avoidance, and we shall examine these in Topic 11.

The type of defences we shall be dealing with in this topic, **failure of proof defences**, do not act outside the elements of the offence; rather, they provide the evidential basis for a claim that one of these elements (actus reus or mens rea or both) is lacking. Illustration 1 shows how such a defence may surface in a criminal case.

### **Illustration 1**

D, witnessed by a crowd of onlookers, aims his gun at V and shoots him dead.

To gain a conviction for murder, the prosecution bears the burden of proving:

- that D's act caused V's death
- that D's shooting of the gun was actuated by an intention to kill V or cause him serious injury.

As you may appreciate, this should not be too difficult, given that there are:

- witnesses who saw D aim the gun and pull the trigger
- witnesses who saw V fall down immediately after the gun was fired
- doctors who will confirm that V's death was caused by the blood loss occasioned by the bullet entering V's body.

Indeed, in a case like this, D's counsel will no doubt recommend that D plead guilty because the chances of an acquittal are next to nothing.

Occasionally, however, D may be able to deflect a finding that all the elements of an offence are present despite the most compelling of physical evidence. For example, in this case, D might adduce evidence suggesting that, although it might have appeared to the witnesses that he intended to kill V, in fact he did not. For instance, D

might adduce evidence that he was intoxicated and that he thought V was a scarecrow, or that he was insane and thought V was the devil, or that he was sleepwalking and that he was quite unaware of what he was doing. If these claims may have been true, D is entitled to be acquitted, since they amount to a plausible claim that one of the elements of the offence is missing (*mens rea*).

There are a number of defences whose function is to regulate the conditions under which a defendant is permitted to adduce evidence of this nature. The defences in question are known as **failure of proof** defences. They include intoxication, mistake, automatism and insanity. The scope of these defences is strictly controlled in order to ensure that a finding of accountability is not too easily deflected. It is not enough for D simply to claim that they were sleepwalking or acting under duress to require the prosecution to prove otherwise. This would be too much of a burden on the prosecution. In order to ensure that D's claim is worthy of being taken seriously by the jury, D is required to adduce some evidence strong enough to introduce some reasonable doubt into a juror's mind as to whether the prosecution's case is as robust as it claims. This might include, in connection with the claims raised by D in Illustration 1, medical evidence - for example, a doctor's report that D was a serial sleepwalker. Or evidence from a witness that D had been seen lying drunk in a ditch an hour before the shooting. Or, in the case of an affirmative defence, evidence from a witness that X was a man known to exact compliance through violence and had been witnessed threatening D prior to the robbery.

In this topic, we will cover three failure of proof defences: namely, involuntary conduct, insanity and intoxication.

## 10.2 Involuntary conduct

Involuntary conduct is the prime example of a failure of proof defence, since it can be used to negate either actus reus or mens rea - in other words, responsibility for the crime. That it negates responsibility may be of considerable importance to the defence, since it may be used to negate liability, even for strict liability crimes which do not require proof of *mens rea*. The essence of the defence is that the criminal conduct complained of was not done by D: rather, it happened to them. In Hill y Baxter [1958] 1 QB 277, the defendant was charged with dangerous driving, having blacked out at the wheel. Although D's defence was disallowed by the Court of Appeal, it accepted, in the following famous statement of principle, that voluntariness of action was central to criminal responsibility even for strict liability offences:

there may be cases where the circumstances are such that the accused could not really be said to be driving at all. Suppose he had a stroke or an epileptic fit, both instances of what may properly be called acts of God; he might well be in the driver's seat even with his hands on the wheel, but in such a state of unconsciousness that he could not be said to be driving. A blow from a stone or an attack by a swarm of bees I think introduces some conception akin to novus actus interveniens.

You will understand from the above statement that the defence may take one of two forms:

- a loss of physical control over one's conduct prompted by some external event, such as a bee attack
- a loss of mental control due to a trigger such as a stroke or epileptic fit.

The criminal law has traditionally called both instances 'automatism'. In the words of Lord Denning in Bratty v A-G of Northern Ireland [1963] AC 386:

No act is punishable if it is done involuntarily: and an involuntary act in this context – some people nowadays prefer to speak of it as 'automatism' – means an act which is done by the muscles without any control by the mind...

In this topic we shall deal with the two forms of automatism separately, since certain biological or mental conditions which trigger involuntary behaviour may lead to distinct case outcomes.

### 10.2.1 Physical involuntariness

We have come across the concept of involuntary action already in the context of causation (see Topic 4). You will remember that a person's conduct is causally effective only when it is voluntary. It is for this reason that in Mitchell (1983) it was Mitchell who was deemed to be the cause of the elderly woman's death rather than the man whom

Mitchell caused to fall on top of her. In Hill v Baxter (1958) above, an attack by a swarm of bees or blow on the head was said to be comparable.

Similar principles apply where something goes wrong with a car. For example, in Burns v Bidder [1967] 2 QB 227, a driver was charged with the offence of failing to accord precedence to a pedestrian on a crossing. His defence was that his action was involuntary, as he had suffered brake failure. The court held that if this had happened without any fault on the part of the driver – for example, because the defect was not the result of poor maintenance - then he was entitled to an acquittal. Even a strict liability offence, which this was, requires voluntary action to constitute the actus reus.

### 10.2.2 Automatism

The other form of involuntary behaviour, also known as automatism, occurs where the accused is effectively unconscious while committing the offence. Again, successful raising of this defence means that the accused is entitled to an absolute acquittal. There are, however, dangers attached to raising this defence; namely that the judge may treat the mental condition relied upon to support the defence as involving a 'disease of the mind'. This is dangerous because it may trigger the special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. Although the special verdict involves an acquittal, it is not an unqualified acquittal, since it affords the judge a number of powers of disposal, including mandatory hospitalisation.

An example of how a plea of automatism may backfire occurred in Bratty. The defendant killed a young woman by strangling her with her own stockings. D pleaded automatism, relying on evidence that he suffered from psychomotor epilepsy at the time of the offence, and had blacked out and knew nothing of what he had done. Lord Denning in the Court of Appeal ruled that the trial judge was correct in

his ruling that D's mental condition was due to disease of the mind and could only be presented to the court as insanity. Although receiving the special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, D was committed indefinitely to a secure mental hospital. From his point of view, at least, a conviction might have been preferable.

The later case of Quick [1973] QB 910 represents one of the very few cases where the plea was successful. D was a psychiatric nurse working in a mental hospital. He was a diabetic. On the day in question, he had taken insulin, had also taken alcohol and had eaten little food. For a diabetic, this is a dangerous combination, because it may induce hypoglycaemia, a deficiency of blood sugar which can impair consciousness and trigger aggressive outbursts. And so it transpired. In this condition, D attacked a patient, causing him injury, and was charged with assault.

In his defence, D claimed that he lacked mens rea due to being in an automatic state brought on by hypoglycaemia. The judge refused to allow this defence to go to the jury, ruling, as in Bratty, that it was one of insanity. D changed his plea to guilty. He appealed on the ground that the judge was wrong to refuse to allow his condition to be presented as automatism as opposed to insanity. The Court of Appeal allowed his appeal on the basis that his hypoglycaemia was a condition that had been triggered by the taking of insulin, and so not a mental condition caused by a disease of the mind, but – like blows on the head or an attack by a swarm of bees – was caused by an external factor which deprives the actor temporarily of control over his actions. Lawton LJ explained it as:

...a malfunctioning of the mind of transitory effect caused by the application to the body of some external factor such as violence, drugs (including anaesthetics), alcohol or hypnotic influences.

#### **Study task 1**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 9.8.C 'Conditions of automatism' and answer the following questions.

- a. Why did Quick change his plea to guilty?
- b. Why was the defendant in  $T(1990)$  able to use her condition to support her claim of automatism but not the defendant in Rabey (1978)?
- c. Search the term 'confusional arousal' on the internet. Can you think of an example of how experiencing this condition might cause someone to perform a prohibited act?

 Show feedback

- a. He thought it was preferable to be convicted rather than being committed to a mental hospital which, at that time, was the only option following a special verdict.
- b. Because what had happened to her (rape) was more extraordinary than what had happened to Mr Rabey (being dumped).
- c. You are staying at an acquaintance's house. You are awoken by your host from a deep sleep in the morning before it is light. He has brought you a cup of tea. It is dark, you do not know where you are, you have no idea who the person is, you panic and attack him.

Success rates in using automatism as a defence are relatively poor. There are three reasons for this.

- Automatism can be used for all crimes, even crimes of strict liability, where the prosecution does not need to prove fault on the part of the defendant. Driving offences are prime examples. The policy behind such offences is that it would be counterproductive to require proof of fault. If society wants to stop bad driving, the best way is to make it known that whatever the excuse bad driving will be punished. In deference to this policy, the courts have shown a marked reluctance to allow no-fault liability to be undermined by a claim of automatism.
- The defence cannot be relied upon if the defendant was at fault in inducing the condition.
- The courts insist upon medical evidence to support the claim and, as can be seen from Bratty and Quick, even then the danger is that the defence will be construed as involving a disease of the mind. We will examine the difference between automatism and insanity later. Underpinning such decisions is a judicial reluctance to allow an unqualified acquittal to those whose mental condition may reoccur, particularly if violence was involved.

These three reasons will now be explored.

#### Strict liability offences

We have seen that automatism can be used even for strict liability offences. This is because automatism is not simply a denial of mens rea; it is also a denial of responsibility for the actus reus. In Burns v Bidder, the accused escaped liability on the basis that he was not 'driving' his car, not on the basis that he was not at fault in driving it badly.

The courts have kept strictly to this idea that automatism can only operate to negate voluntary action, not fault, in strict liability offences. In Neal v Reynolds [1966] Crim LR 394, D was charged with failing to accord precedence to a pedestrian on a crossing. Like the defendant in Burns v Bidder, D's defence was that this was involuntary; he could not avoid failing to give precedence to the pedestrian because that same pedestrian had dashed out without warning and without giving him the chance to stop. The court refused the defence on the basis that D, despite the action of the pedestrian, was fully in control of his vehicle and so was not acting involuntarily. He was driving the car. He was not at fault, certainly, but the offence charged did not require proof of fault.

Comparable decisions were reached in Broome v Perkins (1987) 85 Cr App R 321 and A-G's Reference (No 2 of 1992) [1994] QB 91, in both of which cases the defendant was charged with driving dangerously when their mind was not fully conscious due to matters outside their control – hypoglycaemia in the former, a trance-like state induced by the defendant's concentrated attention to the lines separating the motorway carriageways in the latter. Their defences of automatism failed on the ground that it was available only where there was a complete loss of conscious control.

#### Prior fault

The defendant in Quick was a touch fortunate in having his conviction quashed. If the trial judge had directed the jury as he ought. D would probably have been properly convicted at first instance. What the judge should have told the jury was that it should acquit if it thought D may not have been aware of what he was doing due to his hypoglycaemia unless he was at fault in getting himself into that condition. The jury may well have concluded that D was at fault, since a diabetic would usually know that after taking insulin it was important not to drink alcohol on an empty stomach. Lawton LJ made this clear when hearing the appeal: 'A self-induced incapacity will not excuse... nor will one which could reasonably have been foreseen'.

In Bailey [1983] 1 WLR 760, on similar facts, the Court of Appeal ruled that what was important was not what 'could reasonably have been foreseen' but what actually was foreseen by the accused. Only if the accused actually foresaw that his failure to eat and drink properly might cause him to become 'aggressive, unpredictable and uncontrolled with the result that he may cause injury to others' would a conviction be proper.

These were not cases of self-induced automatism but preventable automatism. Cases of self-induced automatism are treated slightly differently. Where the defendant's automatism is the result of voluntary intoxication with drink or drugs, they are disabled from using it as a defence for all crimes except crimes of specific intent; that is, crimes where the prosecution has to show that the accused specifically intended the consequences of their act. For all other crimes, voluntary intoxication is treated as a basis in itself for a conviction.

In Lipman [1970] 1 QB 152, the defendant went on an 'acid trip' (took the hallucinogenic drug LSD) with his girlfriend. He awoke sometime later to find her dead of suffocation; he had stuffed a sheet in her mouth while hallucinating that she was a snake. He was charged with manslaughter. D's defence of automatism was rejected on the basis that his condition was self-induced. If he had been charged with murder, which requires proof of a specific intent to kill or cause serious injury, he could have used the evidence of his acid trip to negate his mens rea. No such relief was available for manslaughter, however.

The rule that self-induced automatism is not a defence applies only where the defendant's intoxication was voluntary. If, in Lipman, the LSD tablet had been introduced into D's food without him knowing, or if his hallucination was caused by drugs taken under medical prescription, the intoxication would be involuntary and he would have been able to rely on it. In Hardie [1985] 1 WLR 64, the Court of Appeal added a further qualification, comparable to the decision in Bailey, that the voluntary consumption of a drug (here Valium) not known to result in unpredictable and aggressive behaviour could be relied upon in support of the defendant's claim (on a charge of arson) that he lacked awareness of what he was doing.

Both Bailey and Hardie are authorities for the broader proposition that, for crimes of mens rea, only those who are at fault in permitting themselves to lapse into aggressive and unpredictable behaviour are denied the defence. Similarly, for crimes of negligence, automatism will not be a defence if the condition could have been prevented by the taking of reasonable care. In Kay v Butterworth (1945) 61 TLR 452, for example, it was affirmed that falling asleep at the wheel, or brake failure due to not servicing a car properly, is no defence to careless or dangerous driving. This is consistent with the point that taking a sedative would be no answer to a charge of dangerous or reckless driving. Indeed, if it resulted in the defendant falling asleep at the wheel, it would provide the prosecution with all the evidence it needed to secure the conviction!

#### Insanity (insane automatism)

As we have seen, automatism can be the result of loss of physical control or loss of mental control over one's actions. In the latter case, the defendant is relying upon a mental condition which rendered them unaware of what they were doing. By raising such evidence before the court, the defendant is, of course, putting their sanity at issue. In a number of cases a plea of automatism has been rejected by the court and construed as one of insanity. It is therefore important to be able to distinguish insanity (or insane automatism) from simple automatism. In the next section, we will examine insanity in detail.

## 10.3 Insanity

The defence of insanity is unusual in a number of ways. First, if successfully raised it will not result in an unqualified acquittal, but rather a special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. Upon such verdict, the court has a wide-ranging dispositive discretion, which includes hospital order, guardianship, absolute discharge and supervision (Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991). Before 1991, the only power available was mandatory indefinite committal to a mental hospital at the Home Secretary's discretion (Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964, s.5 and Schedule 1. As a result, the defence was understandably unpopular with defendants who might otherwise have wished to avail themselves of it (R.D. Mackay 'Fact and fiction about the insanity defence' [1990] Crim LR 247). The case law contains a number of instances of defendants relying upon non-insane automatism, who changed their plea to guilty upon the trial judge ruling that their defence was properly one of insanity (see, for example, *Bratty* and *Hennessy* below). Even a 'life' sentence for murder may be preferable to an indefinite committal – which might really mean life (although, as Mackay's research shows (1990, pp.254– 55), judges did not always implement the mandatory hospital order. Although the defence has not gained significantly in popularity since the change in the law, it seems likely to do so, given the wide-ranging discretion now available (R. Mackay and G. Kearns 'The continued underuse of unfitness to plead and the insanity defence' [1994] Crim LR 576).

A second unusual characteristic is that, unlike other defences, it may be raised by either defence or prosecution. The prosecution may raise it when the defendant puts his sanity at issue, for example by pleading diminished responsibility (Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964, s.6) or non-insane automatism (Bratty v A-G for Northern Ireland [1963] AC 386 at 411–12 per Lord Denning; Dickie [1984] 3 All ER 173 at 180 per Watkin LJ). When this occurs, the standard of proof is the criminal standard (beyond reasonable doubt: Podola [1959] 3 All ER 418; Robertson [1968] 3 All ER 557; see also, though, Bratty at 411-12 per Lord Denning). When raised by the defence, the burden of proof is with the defendant rather than, as is usual, the prosecution. The standard of proof in these cases is the balance of probability. A right of appeal exists against a special verdict, even though, technically, the defendant has been found not quilty (Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964, s.2).

#### 10.3.1 The M'Naghten rules

The legal notion of insanity is captured and defined in a statement of principle which derives from a famous case in 1843 when Daniel M'Naghten, in an attempt to assassinate the prime minister, Robert Peel, instead only succeeded in killing his private secretary. M'Naghten was found not guilty by reason of insanity on the grounds that he was suffering an insane delusion that the prime minister and his constituents were conspiring against him at the time of his act. So incensed were the public at M'Naghten's acquittal that the House of Lords asked a panel of judges to establish rules governing the defence of insanity. These rules are known as the M'Naghten rules.

On the precise issue in the case, namely insane delusions, their Lordships concluded that an insane delusion would act as a defence only if, assuming the delusion was true, it would have entitled the defendant to do as he did. In  $R$  v Oye [2013] EWCA Crim 1725, the defendant attacked police officers under the insane delusion that they were evil spirits attacking him. His defence of self-defence was rejected by the Court of Appeal. The correct defence was that of insanity. Assuming his delusion to be true, he would have been justified in using force to defend himself. Similarly, if M'Naghten's insane delusion was that Sir Robert Peel was about to kill him, the defence would have stood, since killing in self-defence is permitted. On the facts, however, M'Naghten's insane delusion was insufficient; that someone is conspiring against you does not excuse or justify killing the conspirator. The body of the M'Naghten rules is as follows.

[E]very man is presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved...and...to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at the time of committing the act the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or as not to know that what he was doing was wrong.

As can be appreciated from this statement, insanity, like automatism, is not simply a denial of *mens rea*. An insane person may intend what they are doing without appreciating its true quality or that it is (legally) wrong. In Loake, the defendant sent a very large number of text messages over a period of time to her husband, from whom she was separated. She was convicted of harassment contrary to s.2 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 in the magistrates' court. L appealed against her conviction and sentence on the basis that she was not guilty by reason of her insanity. At the Crown Court, the judge ruled that the defence of insanity was not available for an offence of harassment, as the offence did not require proof that she knew that what she was doing was wrongful. Her further appeal was successful. Insanity is a defence to all crimes, including crimes of strict liability and crimes of objective fault. In other words, like automatism, it is not simply a denial of mens rea. A person may know what they are doing but may not realise, because of a disease of the mind, that it mounts to harassment. This is what happened here. Her defect of reason prevented her from understanding the nature and quality of her act and that what she was doing was wrong. She lacked responsibility, not mens rea.

As may also be appreciated from this statement, there is a considerable overlap between insanity and automatism. A defendant who suffers from a defect of reason, which renders them unaware of what they are doing or its nature and quality, can be in either a state of sane or insane automatism (insanity). The difference between them lies in the cause of that disorder. With insanity, the defect of reason results from a disease of the mind. So what exactly is a disease of the mind?

#### 10.3.2 Disease of the mind

The notion of a disease of the mind owes nothing to the current state of knowledge regarding mental illness: it is a matter of legal rather than medical definition. The current legal position is that many who would not be considered to have a disease of the mind by any ordinary measure are so treated by the criminal law.

The ruling test for a disease of the mind is that of Devlin J in the case of Kemp [1957] 1 QB 399. The defendant attacked his wife with a hammer, causing her grievous bodily harm. The medical evidence showed that D suffered from arterial sclerosis (hardening of the arteries), a condition which restricts the flow of blood to the brain, and this caused a temporary lapse of consciousness. D sought to raise the defence of automatism. Devlin J rejected this defence, ruling that it was one of insanity:

...The condition of the brain is irrelevant and so is the question of whether the condition of the mind is curable or incurable, transitory or permanent... Hardening of the arteries is a disease which is... capable of affecting the mind in such a way as to cause a defect, temporarily or permanently, of its reasoning, understanding and so on, and so is in my judgment a disease of the mind...within the meaning of the rules.

The deceptively simple result of this test is that defects of reason are treated as insanity if triggered by an internal condition, but as (simple) automatism if triggered by an external cause.

Although a simple test, the Devlin test is by no means a convincing one. Consider, for example, the medical condition of diabetes. Diabetes can produce defects of reason involving loss of conscious awareness in two separate ways. It can produce hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) where the person takes insulin but does not compensate its effects with an appropriate dietary regime. It can also produce hyperglycaemia (excess blood sugar) where the person fails to take their insulin as instructed. Both conditions can result in the kind of mental confusion, unconscious action and/or aggression which can trigger criminal activity.

As we have seen (Quick), if D suffers hypoglycaemia (without fault on their part) induced by the taking of insulin (external trigger), the condition is treated as one of simple automatism and they receive an unqualified acquittal (Bingham [1991] Crim LR 433, in which a conviction for theft was quashed). If, however, D suffers hyperglycaemia as a result of not taking insulin (internal cause), the condition is treated as one of insanity (insane automatism) (Hennessy (1989) 89 Cr App R 10). In short: similar condition, totally different outcome.

#### **Study task 2**

Why have the courts ignored medical definitions in deciding upon the meaning of a disease of the mind?

On the basis of this internal/external test, acts of violence committed while sleepwalking (Burgess (1991) 93 Cr App R 41; Lowe (2005)); while suffering an epileptic seizure (Sullivan [1984] AC 156) or while suffering clinical depression (Rabey (1980) DLR 193) have all been designated the result of conditions of insanity rather than of simple automatism. In the case of sleepwalking, this is particularly ironic given that this was traditionally proposed as the classic example of automatism (see the Bratty quotation in Section 3.1.2). This is no longer the case, at least if (as it usually will) it stems from an internal susceptibility.

#### 10.3.3 Second limb of the M'Naghten rules

The M'Naghten rules also permit the insanity defence for those who know what they are doing but do not 'know that it is wrong'. This has subsequently been construed to mean 'legally' wrong, so is not available to a person who believes that they have God's consent to commit the relevant crime or whose disordered mental state convinces them that the criminal law is overridden by the demands of morality. So in Windle [1952] 2 QB 826, D, a husband who killed his suicidal wife at her request believing, in his mentally disordered state, that it was right to do so, was unable to raise the defence. When he was arrested, D had said to the police, I suppose they will hang me for this'. In saying this, D signalled his understanding that what he was doing was legally wrong. That was unfortunate enough. More unfortunately, however, at that time murder was a capital offence.

Windle was recently followed in R v Keal [2022] EWCA Crim 341. The appellant, K, was convicted of three counts of attempted murder. The victims were his parents and grandmother. His case at trial, supported by psychiatrists, was that he was insane at the time of the acts and suffering from delusions. K argued that the defence of insanity was available to a psychotic and deluded defendant who was aware that his act was wrong but believed himself to be compelled to perform it. The judge accepted the argument of prosecuting counsel that a person suffering from delusions, who nevertheless knew that what he was doing was legally or morally wrong, was not insane within the meaning of the M'Naghten rules, although he may have been compelled, by those delusions, to act as he did. The Court of Appeal agreed, saying that it would be for Parliament not the courts to decide otherwise. At present, the defendant's particular mental condition could only be used to support a defence of diminished responsibility.

## Reflective activity 1

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 9.9.A.3 'Disease of the mind'.

Note down as many difficulties associated with the 'internal/external cause' test of insanity/automatism as you can find. Concentrate particularly on the discussions relating to diabetes and sleepwalking. When you have done this, consider whether Hennessy would have been in a stronger position to claim automatism if he had forgotten or failed to take his insulin due to:

- 1. the sudden death of his child
- 2. a fire at his home
- 3. an unlawful attack on his person

## Mini lecture 2 - Failure of proof defences

Prof William Wilson, Criminal law

Failure of proof defences, intoxication. This diagram shows how general defences can be categorized as either involving failure of proof or a defence of reasonable reaction. The latter defences block criminal liability although the accused has performed the *actus reus* of the offence with *mens rea*. These defences are superimposed onto the conditions of liability. The other type of defence is known as a failure of proof defence. These defences operate by negating one of the elements of the offence, most commonly, the *mens rea*.

Take a look at this illustration. It's from an important case called Lipman, a man went on an LSD trip with his girlfriend. In the course of this trip, he hallucinating that she was a snake trying to bite him. He stuffed a sheet inside her mouth, she died of suffocation. If Lipman is permitted to adduce evidence that he was hallucinating due to taking LSD, which caused him to make this mistake, the jury will no doubt acquit of murder for lack of *mens rea*. We need to know the circumstances when this permission will be granted. As the following slide show, this depends upon whether the intoxication is voluntary or involuntary.

Lipman's intoxication was voluntary. He took the drug of his own free will. The consequence was that he was acquitted of murder because he did not form any intention to kill or cause serious injury. However, he was found guilty of manslaughter, which does not require proof of such intention, only requires the prosecution to show that Lipman acted in a very dangerous fashion, which of course he did. The following slides explain how the availability of the defence varies according to whether the intoxication was voluntary or not.

Let's look first at the case of involuntary intoxication. If D is involuntarily intoxicated, he is not guilty of any crime of *mens rea* if, by reason of the intoxication, he failed to form *mens rea,* that is, any intention or foresight required by the crime definition, the defendant will remain liable for crimes of strict liability or negligence, even though he would not have committed the crimes if sober. Now, let us look at the case of voluntary intoxication. If the defendant is voluntarily intoxicated, he will not be allowed to use this to support a claim that he lacked *mens rea* unless the crime is one, like murder, where the prosecution have to show that the defendant specifically intended to do what he did, and intended the consequences. These are known as crimes of specific intent.

Take a note of these crimes of specific intent. You should remember them. What they all have in common is they cannot be committed by recklessness. If a crime does not require proof of a specific intent, it is known as a crime of basic intent. Lack of *mens rea* due to intoxication does not help a person charged with one of these crimes. It is no answer to a charge of assault or criminal damage or malicious wounding, that the defendant was too drunk to know what he was doing. This was the claim made in Majewski, a case on assaulting a police officer and Caldwell, a case of arson.

Almost all specific intent crimes have a basic intent counterpart. If the evidence shows that the defendant was voluntarily intoxicated at the time of committing the offence, the prosecution will charge the crime of basic intent. The basic intention counterpart of murder is manslaughter. The basic intent counterpart of wounding with intent, is malicious wounding, and so on. If, as in

Lipman, the defence case is that they were involuntarily intoxicated, all that prosecution need to do to get a conviction is to charge manslaughter rather than murder. This is because manslaughter is a basic intent crime, whereas murder is a specific intent crime.

We have discovered that intoxication is relevant, if at all, only if it negates the *mens rea* for the crime charged. Where the intoxication is involuntary, it can be used to support a claim of lack of *mens rea* for all crimes of *mens rea*. Where the intoxication is voluntary, it can only be used in connection with the small class of crimes, known as crimes of specific intent. Even then, there will normally be a lesser basic intent crime available to the prosecution, for which intoxication is unhelpful to the defence. It's important to be able to distinguish between cases of voluntary and involuntary intoxication. How do we do so?

Voluntary intoxication was defined in Majewski as the intoxication of a person by an intoxicant, which he takes otherwise than properly for a medicinal purpose, and according to medical instruction, knowing that it is or may be an intoxicant. Obvious cases of voluntary intoxication include taking alcohol or psychoactive drugs, other than for a medical purpose. Cases of involuntary intoxication include the following on this slide. You'll find discussion of these in the study guide at 9.11.B so do look at this carefully.

Let's look at case study. This is the question posed in your study guide. If you do not analyse the case study properly, you're likely to conclude that since the intoxication is involuntary, Adam has a defence because it does not matter for involuntary intoxication, whether the offence is one of specific or basic intent. If you look more carefully, you'll see that this is false. To analyse the question properly, we must first ask, what offence Adam will be charged with? The answer is assault.

The next question is what the elements of assault are? The first element is the *actus reus* which is unconsented to physical contact. This is obviously present. The second element is the *mens rea*. The *mens rea* for assault is intention or recklessness. The question at issue is, did Adam intend to make physical contact with Cain? Or if not, did he foresee this happening? Have a look at this question and make your own decision.

If you read the question properly, it is quite clear that Adam does indeed intend to punch Cain. He is indignant and loses his temper. Does it make any difference that Adam's intoxication was an intoxicant secretly administered to Adam without his knowledge, that is, was involuntary? The answer is, no. Involuntary intoxication is only helpful to the defence if it prevents Adam from forming *mens rea*, which it doesn't.

The question also asks whether Adam should be guilty of assaulting Cain. Morally, you may think, he should not be. After all, Adam is a classic man and clearly, would not have punched Cain unless he had had his drink spiked in this way. Moreover, Cain is the person responsible for spiking his drink. The principle retribution holds that a person should only be found guilty of an offence and punished if he deserves it. The question for you then is, does he deserve it? What is your answer to this question?

## Mini lecture 3 - FAILURE OF PROOF DENFENCES: INTOXICATION
Prof William Wilson


Failure of proof defenses. This mini-lecture deals with intoxication, what is commonly termed a failure of proof defense. Intoxication, like insanity and automatism, is a failure of proof defense. It's important is that it may be used to substantiate the defendant's claim that he lacked mens rea for the offense. It is not a true defense like duress or self-defense. It is no answer to strict liability crimes or crimes of negligence as these do not require proof of mens rea.

For example, in *R v Blakely and Sutton*, D spiked B's soft drink with alcohol at a party. B, unaware of this, drove home. B was held guilty of driving with excess alcohol, a strict liability crime which does not require proof of fault. The fact that he was intoxicated through no fault of his own did not provide him with a defense.

There are two categories of intoxication: voluntary and involuntary intoxication. The rules as to whether evidence of intoxication can be adduced to negate mens rea differ depending upon which category of intoxication the defendant experienced.

A person who commits an offense while involuntarily intoxicated has a defense to a crime requiring proof of mens rea but only if it prevents the accused from forming mens rea. Authority for this is *Kingston*. Kingston committed a sexual assault on V under the influence of drugs which had been given to him secretly by X. He would not have committed the offense if sober. The House of Lords held that he was guilty as he had the mens rea for the assault. Kingston was involuntarily intoxicated, but it didn't help him because he still formed the intention to sexually assault the young boy.

Here is two examples which will help us to understand this position. In Case 1, Eve spikes Adam's soft drink with alcohol at a party. He is unaware of this. When it is time to go, he goes into the kitchen for a glass of water. Having drunk it, he misjudges the distance between the glass and the sink because of his intoxication. The glass falls and breaks.

In Case 1, on a charge of criminal damage, Adam must be acquitted because his intoxication had the effect of depriving him of either the intention or the foresight of the risk of harm which criminal damage requires.

Compare this with Case 2. In Case 2, although Adam is involuntarily intoxicated, he has no defense to the charge of assault because intoxication notwithstanding, he clearly has the mens rea for assault, which in this case is the intention to punch the officer. A drunk intent is still an intent.

We have seen that where the intoxication is involuntary, it acts as a defense if it prevents the accused from forming the mens rea for the crime charged. What about where the intoxication is voluntary? For example, where D gets himself drunk at a party? Voluntary intoxication was defined in *Majewski* as the intoxication of a person by an intoxicant which he takes otherwise than properly for a medicinal purpose and according to medical instruction, knowing that it is or may be an intoxicant.

Voluntary intoxication is only useful with respect to a limited category of crimes. These are known as crimes of specific intent and are crimes such as murder, where, to gain a conviction, the prosecution must prove that the defendant intended to produce the actus reus or intended some further consequence, such as wounding with intent.

Take a look at the *Director of Public Prosecutions v Beard*. This case tells you much of what you need to know regarding crimes of specific intent. In this case, the appellant whilst intoxicated raped a young girl and put his hand over her mouth to stop her from screaming. She died of suffocation. He was charged with murder. His conviction was quashed by the House of Lords.

In so doing, Lord Birkenhead said the following, "Where a specific intent is an essential element in the offense, evidence of a state of drunkenness rendering the accused incapable of forming such an intent should be taken into consideration in order to determine whether he had in fact formed the intent necessary to constitute the particular crime. If he was so drunk that he was incapable of forming the intent required, he could not be convicted of a crime which was committed only if the intent was proved….In a charge of murder based upon intention to kill or to do grievous bodily harm, if the jury are satisfied that the accused was, by reason of his drunken condition, incapable of forming the intent to kill or to do grievous bodily harm ... he cannot be convicted of murder. But nevertheless, unlawful homicide has been committed by the accused, and consequently, he is guilty of unlawful homicide without malice aforethought, and that is manslaughter."

The vast majority of crimes are known as crimes of basic intent. For these crimes, there is no point in pleading voluntary intoxication since voluntary intoxication is treated as a form of fault for these crimes. Authority for this is *Majewski*. Majewski was drunk, drugged up, and disorderly in a pub. The police were called and he attacked them. He was charged with assault. Majewski pleaded lack of mens rea. The trial judge told the jury to ignore the effect of alcohol in considering whether Majewski was guilty of assaulting the police officers. The House of Lords dismissed his appeal.

Voluntary intoxication was not a defense to a criminal charge unless it prevented the defendant from forming any special or specific intent required by the offense definition. Since assault did not require such an intent, his intoxication was irrelevant. If he'd been charged with wounding with intent, he would have had a defense, but he wasn't. Crimes of negligence and recklessness are therefore automatically crimes of basic intent.

It is important to realize that intoxication has only very limited power to excuse. This is because almost all specific intent crimes have a basic intent counterpart. So as we saw in *DPP v Beard*, a person who escaped liability for murder relying on their voluntary intoxication will still be guilty of manslaughter. Similarly, a person who escapes liability for wounding with intent would still be guilty of malicious wounding.

Intoxicated mistakes as to a defense, for example, duress and self-defense, cannot be relied upon even for crimes of specific intent such as murder. Authority for that proposition is *O'Connor*. D relied on self-defense in answer to the charge of murder. In this case, he was intoxicated and believed he was being attacked when he was not. The House of Lords ruled that intoxicated mistakes cannot be relied upon even for murder even though this was a specific intent crime.

## 10.4 Intoxication

Intoxication, like other failure of proof defences, is not a defence in itself. Indeed, it is more like an anti-defence. If a person kills another, inflamed by drink, or drives a car dangerously due to the influence of alcohol, this exacerbates rather than excuses or mitigates the wrong. Intoxication, when it affects liability, operates, to provide an evidential basis for a claim of no mens rea. Consider again the case of Lipman above. Without the evidence of D having taken LSD, the jury would have had no reason to believe his action was not deliberately undertaken and so, in the absence of such evidence, would no doubt have convicted him of murder. People do not tend to stuff sheets into the mouths of others unless they want to kill them; and the jury would know this. As it was, the evidence was forthcoming and so it could convict only of manslaughter. So something, at least, went right for Lipman!

It is easy to forget this aspect of the so-called defence of intoxication, namely that it is of evidential value only and that its value is not by way of excusing D's wrongdoing but rather to substantiate D's claim that they lacked the mens rea (i.e. the intention, knowledge or foresight) of the crime charged. It is for this reason that intoxication – even involuntary intoxication – is not a defence to crimes of negligence or strict liability unless it can be presented as one of automatism. So, in Blakely and Sutton [1991] RTR 405, D spiked B's soft drink with alcohol at a party. B, unaware of this, drove home and was stopped by police on the way and breathalysed. B was properly found guilty of driving with excess alcohol. The fact that he was unaware of his condition is no answer to a strict liability crime, which does not require proof of fault.

For crimes of mens rea, if D has the mens rea for the crime charged, they will remain guilty even though they would not have committed the offence if sober. This important point of law was confirmed in Kingston [1995] 2 AC 355. D committed a sexual assault on V, an underage boy, under the influence of drugs which had been given to him secretly by X. (X's plan was to photograph the event and use it to blackmail D.) D was charged and convicted of indecent assault. He appealed on the ground that it was an excuse that his intoxication was involuntary and that he would not have committed the offence if sober.

The House of Lords, reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal, who had surprisingly ruled in his favour, said that D was properly convicted, since the effect of the alcohol was to disinhibit D rather than to prevent him from forming the mens rea for the assault. Although D would not have committed the assault if sober, he knew exactly what he was doing and intended to do it. There was no excuse known to the criminal law that D was unwittingly induced to commit an offence he would not have committed otherwise, by the deceitful stratagem of another.

Similarly, in R v Aidid (Kinse) [2021] EWCA Crim 581, where D killed V after an argument following a heavy drinking session, the Court of Appeal approved, and adopted, the following statement in Sheehan and Moore (1974) in dismissing the defendant's appeal:

the mere fact that the defendant's mind was affected by drink so that he acted in a way in which he would not have done had he been sober does not assist him at all, provided that the necessary intent was there, for a drunken intent is nevertheless an intent.

So the first question which must always be asked in a question involving an intoxicated offender is:

'Was the effect of the intoxication to prevent D from forming mens rea or simply to remove D's inhibitions or otherwise inflame D's anger or desires?'

Only in the former case will it avail D to adduce evidence of intoxication.

10.4.1 Restrictions on the use of evidence of intoxication

We have discovered that adducing evidence of intoxication is of use only if the crime charged requires proof of mens rea and the effect of the intoxication is to deprive the defendant of mens rea. If it does not, the defence will, if anything, be counterproductive, providing the prosecution with clear evidence of motivation.

An important qualification to this rule must be added; namely, that if the intoxication is voluntary, it cannot be used, even for this purpose, with respect to a substantial class of crimes of mens rea. These crimes are known as crimes of basic intent. A crime of basic intent, it will be remembered, refers to those crimes of mens rea where the definition of the offence requires no proof that D had any special or specific intent in doing what they did beyond performing the actions which form the *actus reus* of the crime (see Topic 4). For example, the crime of arson requires proof that D intended to light the match used to start the fire. It does not require proof that D specifically intended to damage or destroy property by fire. D's foresight that this consequence might result from their action is enough.

By contrast, murder requires the defendant not merely to intend to do the act which results in the victim's death, but also intend the consequence thereof – death or serious injury, as the case may be. This subtle distinction was first drawn in DPP v Beard [1920] AC 479. While drunk, D raped a young girl, who died of suffocation as a result of him putting his hand over her mouth to prevent her screaming. D's conviction for murder was quashed and a verdict of manslaughter substituted. Lord Birkenhead explained the legal position as follows:

Under the law of England as it prevailed until early in the nineteenth century voluntary drunkenness was never an excuse for criminal misconduct; and indeed the classic authorities broadly assert that voluntary drunkenness must be considered rather an aggravation than a defence. This view was in terms based upon the principle that a man who by his own voluntary act debauches and destroys his will power shall be no better situated in regard to criminal acts than a sober man...[However] where a specific intent is an essential element in the offence, evidence of a state of drunkenness rendering the accused incapable of forming such an intent should be taken into consideration in order to determine whether he had in fact formed the intent necessary to constitute the particular crime. If he was so drunk that he was incapable of forming the intent required he could not be convicted of a crime which was committed only if the intent was proved...

In a charge of murder based upon intention to kill or to do grievous bodily harm, if the jury are satisfied that the accused was, by reason of his drunken condition, incapable of forming the intent to kill or to do grievous bodily harm...he cannot be convicted of murder. But nevertheless unlawful homicide has been committed by the accused, and consequently he is quilty of unlawful homicide without malice aforethought, and that is manslaughter.

Voluntary intoxication, therefore, can support the defendant's claim that they lacked mens rea for a specific intent crime, such as murder. It cannot be so used for crimes of basic intent such as manslaughter, as Lipman later confirmed, where it is no part of the prosecution's case to show that the defendant had anything specifically in mind when acting as they did.

#### 10.4.2 Dutch courage' crimes

One small qualification needs to be added to the principle that voluntary intoxication may be used to negate the mens rea for a crime of specific intent. This is that if the defendant becomes intoxicated in order to gain the courage to commit a specific intent crime, they will not be able to rely on that intoxication. Authority for this proposition is A-G of Northern Ireland v Gallagher [1963] AC 349. In this case, D decided to kill his wife. Before killing her, and to give himself the courage to do so, he drank a bottle of whiskey. The House of Lords, affirming D's conviction for murder, held that, so long as he harboured the intention to kill his wife prior to becoming intoxicated, this was enough. It was not necessary to prove that D had the necessary intention at the time of the actual killing.

#### **Study task 3**

Go to Topic 6. Consider the exceptions to the rule that mens rea and actus reus must coincide in point of time. Insert Gallagher into the text at an appropriate place to give another exception, along with the supposed corpse cases.

### 10.4.3 Voluntary and involuntary intoxication distinguished

To summarise: intoxication can result from either drink or drugs. Involuntary intoxication can be used to negate the intention, foresight, knowledge or belief of all crimes which have this mental element. Voluntary intoxication cannot be used to negate the *mens rea* of all such crimes: it can be used only in respect of crimes of specific intent. The leading case of Majewski [1977] AC 443 characterises voluntary intoxication as:

the intoxication of a person by an intoxicant which he takes otherwise than properly for a medicinal purpose (and according to medical instruction), knowing that it is or may be an intoxicant.

Involuntary intoxication may therefore result from:

- an intoxicant taken under medical supervision
- an intoxicant secretly administered to A without their knowledge (e.g. Kingston)
- an intoxicant voluntarily taken by A, who mistakes its properties. An example is where A takes what they think is a painkiller when in fact it is an intoxicant.

A further qualification was introduced in Hardie [1985] 1 WLR 64, in which D, having been jilted by G, his girlfriend, was advised by G to take some of her Valium to calm himself down. D later set fire to a wardrobe in G's flat. Giving evidence. D claimed that he did not remember starting the fire due to his intoxicated state but conceded that he must have started it as he was alone in the room at the time. Although the Valium was taken wittingly by D, the Court of Appeal quashed his conviction. In effect, the case was treated as one involving involuntary rather than voluntary intoxication, as there was no suggestion that the taking of Valium was a reckless course of conduct.

## 10.5 Crimes of basic intent and specific intent contrasted

There is no consistently applied test to separate crimes of basic and specific intent. However, the usual test used, which is consistent with the explanation given above at Section 10.4.1, is that a crime of basic intent is one which does not require the defendant to have intended any specific consequences of his action. It can be committed by recklessness. Accordingly, in Majewski, it was no defence to a charge of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty that D was oblivious to what he was doing when he attacked the officer in a public house due to the effects of drink and drugs. Assault is a crime of basic intent because it can be committed by recklessness. A crime of specific intent, by contrast, is a crime which requires the defendant to have a consequence in mind when acting. Murder is a crime of specific intent because the prosecution must prove D acted with the intention of killing or causing grievous bodily harm. It cannot be committed by recklessness.

#### **Study task 4**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 9.11.C.2 'The rationale for restricting the exculpatory scope of voluntary intoxication' and answer the question.

What is the rationale for not allowing evidence of intoxication to be used to negate mens rea in crimes of basic intent such as assault?

#### Show feedback

A crime of basic intent is a crime which can be committed recklessly. Getting drunk is a reckless course of action (as it stops people acting responsibly) and so voluntary intoxication supplies the fault element for a crime of basic intent.

#### 10.5.1 Intoxicated mistakes as to a defence

Most criminal defences remain available to the defendant even if they are mistaken as to the facts. So, for example, a person who honestly believes they are about to be attacked may lawfully use reasonable force to defend themselves although the belief was entirely without foundation.

This does not apply where the mistake is induced by voluntary intoxication. By section  $76(4)(b)$  of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, for the purpose of self-defence, D may not rely on any mistaken belief attributable to intoxication that was voluntarily induced. In O'Grady [1987] QB 995, D killed his friend, V, with whom he had been drinking throughout the day, believing, on waking up from sleep, that V was attacking him. The Court

of Appeal ruled that, where a mistake either as to the need to use force in self-defence or the degree of force necessary to defend oneself is made due to voluntary intoxication, self- defence cannot be relied upon. D's conviction for manslaughter was upheld, and the following statement of principle was forthcoming:

We have come to the conclusion that where the jury are satisfied that the defendant was mistaken in his belief that any force or the force which he in fact used was necessary to defend himself and are further satisfied that the mistake was caused by voluntarily induced intoxication, the defence must fail. We do not consider that any distinction should be drawn on this aspect of the matter between offences involving what is called specific intent, such as murder, and offences of so-called basic intent, such as manslaughter.

In O'Connor [1991] Crim LR 135, on similar facts, the Court of Appeal adopted this approach, holding that where a defendant, because of self-induced intoxication, formed a mistaken belief that the use of force was necessary to defend himself, a plea of self-defence failed even in relation to the specific intent crime of murder. Evidence of selfinduced intoxication could be used to negate the *mens rea* for the crime but not to support the defence of selfdefence. Take a look at Illustration 2, which makes this important point clear.

#### **Illustration 2**

### Adam goes to sleep very intoxicated. He wakes up, still drunk, to see Eve standing over him with what appears to be a knife in her hand. It is in fact a cigarette. Adam throws a knife at Eve, which kills her.

If Adam relies on self-defence, he cannot use his intoxication to substantiate his claim that he believed he was being attacked with a knife and so was defending himself. The jury will be told to ignore Adam's intoxication and consider only whether he would have made the mistake if sober.

If, however, Adam claims that he only intended to frighten Eve away, he can use his intoxication to explain why, although he threw a knife at her, he had no lethal intent. This is what defence counsel will hope happened!

In the context of this defence, it appears that it is not necessary for the defendant to actually be intoxicated to be disentitled from relying on his mistaken belief. It is enough that the mistaken belief was attributable to voluntary intoxication, as where recent alcohol abuse has resulted in a temporary, short-term psychotic episode. See the discussion of R v Taj [2018] EWCA Crim 1743 in Section 11.2.

In one situation, and inconsistently with O'Connor, an intoxicated belief has been successfully relied upon to support a defence. This is in relation to s.5(2)(a) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971, which enacts that it is a lawful excuse to a charge of criminal damage that the defendant believed they would have the consent of the owner. In Jaggard v Dickinson [1980] 3 All ER 716, D, stranded with no money after a night's drinking, went round to a friend's house and, having failed to rouse her, broke into the house believing she would have her friend's consent. Unfortunately, she chose the wrong house. The Queen's Bench Division accepted D's defence of lawful excuse. Section 5(2)(a) required only that the belief in consent was honestly entertained. There was no requirement that the belief be reasonable. This case was considered to be of doubtful authority in Magee v Crown Prosecution Service [2014] EWHC 4089 (Admin). A was charged with failing to stop after an accident on a road, as required by s. 170(1) and (2) of the Road Traffic Act 1988. D's defence was that he did not realise that he had had an accident. The Divisional court ruled that this did not afford a defence where, as here, D's lack of awareness was the result of his self-induced intoxication. The offence charged was not a crime of specific intent and so DPP v Majewski [1977] AC 443 applied.

If it asks you to explain and discuss an area of law this requires you to state what the law is, explain what it means, giving examples and then crucially pose questions and answer them about that area of law. So, if the question is about a critical evaluation of dishonesty in theft you state the law (s. 2 Theft Act + Ghosh) you explain it (i.e. s.2 tells you what dishonesty is not...) and then explain that Ghosh helps the court to decide whether someone has been dishonest when s.2 does not apply. You then pose and answer questions, e.g. should dishonesty be a question for the jury applying their own standards, for the defendant applying his standards, or a matter of legal definition; should someone be guilty of a criminal offence when jury opinions on dishonesty might vary? How else might the criminal law set limits on the fault element in theft? Be warned, many students do the first (state and explain) parts well and fall down on the final part but it is the final part that carries the real value added, that is the difference between an ordinary answer and a good (lower second) very good (upper second) or excellent (first) answer. So make sure you have something to contribute when you answer such a question.

The important thing about compare and contrast questions is to ensure you do just that. What you must not do is simply to describe and discuss the essential features of automatism and insanity. Your job is to show how they are similar and how they are different.

Think of an area outside the law and this will help you know what is required. For example, compare and contrast a cat and a mouse.

Comparison (i.e. similarities)

- Both mammals
- Both give birth to live young
- Both resident in most parts of the globe
- Both exist as wild animals

- Both have been domesticated
- Both are main characters in Tom and Jerry.

#### Contrast (i.e. differences)

- Size: the smallest cat is bigger than the biggest mouse
- Different species
- Different descriptive adjectives apply feline/murine
- Different habitats
- Different diets: cat is carnivore; mouse is herbivore
- Cat is predator; mouse is not.
- Cats eat mice; mice do not eat cats.

Before writing your introduction, write first your skeleton. This serves to provide a road map both for the reader and the writer. It should enable both to get from the starting off point to the destination without wrong turnings or having to ask directions. The structure should, like good maps, be clear and the content should be relevant (i.e. nothing there as padding) and well expressed. The skeleton should look like the above structure for cats and mice and paras 5 and 6 for this particular question. If you cannot do one, do not do the question.

#### Introduction

Good introductions show that you have mastered your subject and have something interesting to say on the matter. They are not simply a list of things you aim to talk about. So, a nice start would go something like this:

In this essay I am asked to compare and contrast the defences of automatism and insanity. I shall begin with a general description of insanity and automatism, defining, explaining and marking their points of similarity, for example, that they are all mental condition defences and their points of distinction, for example that both automatism and insanity involve a denial of mens rea or actus reus due to mental condition.

#### Paras 2, 3, 4

Description and exposition of the two defences, including definitions statutory/case law definitions, e.g. Bratty, M'Naghten rules, Quick.

#### Para 5

Comparison of automatism and insanity

- 1. Both are mental condition defences
- 2. Both affect capacity

- 3. Both operate as excuses, i.e. no conviction
- 4. Both require support of medical evidence
- 5. Automatism (always) and insanity (usually) both require the defendant's mental condition to affect D's understanding of the nature and quality of the act.

#### Para 6

Contrast automatism and insanity

- 1. Insanity unlike automatism requires disease of the mind. External/internal dichotomy.
- 2. Automatism = absolute defence. Insanity =qualified defence. Special verdict available.
- 3. Automatism and insanity negate mens rea and actus reus.
- 4. Prior fault operates for automatism (Lipman, Quick, Bailey). Not for insanity.
- 5. Burden of proof differences.

#### Conclusion

Should not simply be a summary. You might wish to conclude, for example, that differentiating them by the internal/external test is not only difficult but also does not always lead to fair case outcomes. For example, a diabetic may be subject to either verdict dependent upon whether their temporary mental disorder is the result of too much or too little blood sugar. Or you might wish to question the value of expert witnesses. Anything in fact that adds a little coda to what has gone before.

Match cases with principles.

- 1. In this case the following statement of principle was made "The condition of the brain is irrelevant and so is the question of wheth condition of the mind is curable or incurable, transitory or permanent. (A disease of the mind is a disease which is... capable of affecting the mind in such a way as to cause a defect, temporarily or permanently, of its reasoning, understanding and so on ...'
- 2. In this case the following statement of principle was made ...'a malfunctioning of the mind of transitory effect caused by the appli to the body of some external factor such as violence, drugs (including anaesthetics), alcohol or hypnotic influences (is not a disea the mind)'
- 3. In this case the following statement of principle was made 'any mental disorder which has manifested itself in violence and is pro recur is a disease of the mind. At any rate it is the sort of disease for which a person would be detained in hospital rather than be an unqualified acquittal.'
- 4. In this case the following statement of principle was made (Voluntary intoxication is) the intoxication of a person by an intoxicant he takes otherwise than properly for a medicinal purpose (and according to medical instruction), knowing that it is or may be an intoxicant
- 5. In this case the defendant attacked his girlfriend. The defence raised the defence of automatism with supporting evidence that it carried out during a sleepwalking episode. The judge ruled that the evidence supported an insanity plea rather than simple automatism. The Court of Appeal, adopting the Kemp test, refused the appeal saying that his sleepwalking was a congenital abnormality and so was an internal factor.  $\checkmark$
- 6. In this case the defendant committed a serious sexual assault on a young boy after his coffee had been spiked, without his know with disinhibiting soporific drugs. The question for the court was whether this involuntary intoxication was a defence. There was r suggestion that he lacked the mens rea for the crime in question The defendant argued that he would not have committed the cri his coffee had not been unlawfully adulterated. This argument succeeded in the Court of Appeal but the House of Lords reinstate conviction. Involuntary intoxication could only avail the defence if, because of it, the defendant failed to form mens rea for the crir charged.
- 7. In this case Defendant's suffered an epileptic seizure during which he attacked V. House of Lords ruled this condition was insanit What was important was not how easily remedied the condition was, but whether it resulted from internal or external causes'
- 8. In this case the defendant, a diabetic, was charged with driving without due care and attention. He had suffered a partial loss of consciousness, having taken insulin. The court ruled that it was not possible for him to rely on automatism since his consciousne and control were seriously impaired rather than absent. He was driving the car badly, albeit without fault, rather than unconscious
- 9. In this case a person who killed his girlfriend while suffering hallucinations from LSD could not rely on automatism as the conditic self-induced.
- 10. In this case the Court of Appeal held that where a defendant, because of self-induced intoxication, formed a mistaken belief that use of force was necessary to defend himself, a plea of self-defence failed even in relation to the specific intent crime of murder. Evidence of self-induced intoxication could be used to negate the mens rea for the crime but not to support the defence of selfdefence

We discussed earlier the need to have a template for answering problem questions and gave some examples. Try to answer this past examination question, testing understanding of intoxication.

Alison and Bertha meet in a bar for a reunion. Alison does not drink alcohol but Bertha puts vodka in her lemonade for a joke, without Alison noticing. Later Bertha suggests to Alison that Alison should drop her glass on the floor to see if it will bounce. Alison does so and the glass breaks. Bertha, who has been drinking beer all evening, later rides off on the landlord's bicycle. When stopped by John, a police officer, Bertha says that she thought the bicycle had been abandoned. When John tries to arrest her, Bertha aims a punch at him which misses and hits Phoebe, a bystander. What offences have been committed and by whom?
