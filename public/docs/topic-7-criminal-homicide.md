## Topic reading

Core text
â€¢ Wilson and Lammasniemi, Chapter 13 'Homicide'.

## Introduction

Criminal homicide comprises two key forms: murder and involuntary manslaughter. Both forms involve a similar actus reus, namely an unlawful killing of a human being. They are distinguished by their respective mental elements.

- Murder requires the killing to be accompanied by an intention to kill, or an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. Manslaughter does not.
- Manslaughter does require proof of fault but the nature of that fault varies according to the type of manslaughter charged.
  - o Reckless manslaughter requires foresight of death or serious injury. It can be committed by commission or omission.
  - Gross negligence manslaughter requires no foresight, but a very high degree of negligence as to the risk of death. It can be committed by commission or omission.
  - Constructive manslaughter requires neither foresight nor even negligence as to the risk of death (or serious injury). It requires simply the commission of a crime likely to cause harm with the relevant mens rea for that crime. It cannot be committed by omission.

### **Illustration 1**

- a. D launches a savage attack on V with fists and feet. V dies in hospital of his injuries.
- b. D, wishing to scare V from the neighbourhood, pours petrol through V's letterbox and sets it alight. V dies in the resulting fire.
- c. D, angry with V, delivers a single punch to V's chin. V falls over and hits his head on the pavement. V dies of the injury due to a weakness in his skull.
- d. D. an anaesthetist, gives V, who is undergoing an operation, a massive overdose of anaesthetic, having failed to notice a decimal point on the dosage recommended in her anaesthetist's handbook. V dies as a result.
- e. D, aged 20, points a gun at V, her 10-year-old brother, in the course of a game and pulls the trigger. D believes it to be the toy gun given to her brother for Christmas. In fact, it is the gun of her mother, who is a police officer, and the gun is loaded. V dies of the wound.

Each of the above illustrations involves the killing of a human being. The first four involve a criminal homicide, since the killing is unlawful.

- a. is murder, since D has the fault element for murder (intention to cause grievous bodily harm).
- b. is reckless manslaughter. Although lacking the intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, there is evidence of foresight of either of these results. It is also constructive manslaughter.
- c. is constructive manslaughter. Although D neither intended nor foresaw death or serious injury, he did intend to cause injury to V, which is sufficient fault for this kind of manslaughter.
- d. is gross negligence manslaughter, which, depending on the jury's view of the matter, is charged when D kills V not in the course of an attack but in the course of doing something so carelessly as to justify holding D to account for the death.
- e, also involves homicide, but it is not a criminal homicide, since D lacks criminal fault and so the killing is not unlawful.

In this topic, we shall begin with an examination of the common elements in murder and involuntary manslaughter, namely that there should be an unlawful killing of a human being. We shall then examine each individual offence in turn, beginning with murder. Murder has three partial defences, which, if successfully raised, reduce murder to voluntary manslaughter. We shall look at two of them: loss of self-control and diminished responsibility. We shall then examine the three forms of involuntary manslaughter.

## 7.1 Common elements in criminal homicide

The common elements in criminal homicide are the prime conduct elements, constituted by 'an unlawful killing of a human being'. These elements comprise a killing, which is unlawful, of a human victim.

### 7.1.1 A killing

A killing in this context follows the general template for all criminal offences. It requires an act or, in the case of murder and gross negligence manslaughter (but not constructive manslaughter), an omission in breach of duty.

#### **Study task 1**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 13.3.A.2 'Unlawful killing' and answer the following questions.

- a. What are the three principal ingredients, which make up a 'killing'?
- b. If V refuses consent to a life-saving operation must his surgeon still perform the operation if she is to avoid a conviction for criminal homicide?
- c. Under what circumstances will an omission to prevent someone from dying amount to a 'killing'? (Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 4.5.D.3 'Circumstances giving rise to a duty to act: duty situations')
- d. For the purpose of criminal homicide, when will D be considered to have caused V's death? (Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 5.5 'Causation: the legal position'.)

Show feedback

- a. The three principal ingredients are:
  - 1. Act, or omission in breach of duty.
  - 2. Death of a human being.
  - 3. Unbroken causal link between act and death.

b. No. Indeed, if she performs the operation she will be guilty of an assault!

### 7.1.2 An unlawful killing

A killing is lawful if it is accidental; that is, not blameworthy (see Illustration 1(e)). It is also lawful if a valid defence operates: for example, self-defence.

Consent is not a defence to liability for criminal homicide by affirmative action: there is no defence of euthanasia or of (consensual) duelling. A recent affirmation of this principle occurred in Nicklinson (2014). Mr Nicklinson suffered from 'locked-in syndrome', following a stroke, which rendered every muscle in his body below his eyelids paralysed. He sought a declaration that it would be lawful on grounds of necessity for his doctors or his wife to terminate his life, since his condition rendered his life intolerable. He claimed that a refusal would be in violation of his human rights and his autonomy, since, because of his total paralysis, he was being denied the rights of all other people to take the steps necessary to kill himself in such intolerable circumstances. His claim was rejected. His appeal was also rejected by the Supreme Court. This decision was later affirmed in the European Court of Human Rights case Nicklinson v UK (Admissibility) (2478/15) (2015) 61 EHRR SE7 on the ground that the matter was so morally contentious that only Parliament could properly address it. It should be noted that no such caution characterised the decision in an equivalent case in Canada (Carter v Canada (Attorney-General) February 6 2015). The prohibition on physician-assisted suicide was declared contrary to human rights by the Supreme Court of Canada. In reaching this conclusion, the Court ruled that the corresponding prohibition in the Canadian Criminal Code (241(b)) infringed s.7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

In November 2024 Parliament voted in favour of advancing legislation that would legalise assisted dying. The Terminally III Adults (End of Life) Bill, known as the Assisted Dying Bill, is in its initial stages. If it passes, for the first time, assisted dying would be decriminalised in England and Wales. Under the Bill, doctors would be able to prepare the substance used to end the patient's life but the person would be required to take the substance themselves. The Bill includes safeguards. Only adults with mental capacity who are terminally ill and expected to die within six months would be eligible to request assisted dying. They must make two requests and satisfy two independent doctors and a High Court judge that they are eligible. The Assisted Dying Bill only addresses assisted dying and it will not legalise euthanasia. Assisted dying differs from euthanasia, where another person, usually a doctor, actively takes steps to end the life of another to relieve their suffering. Euthanasia, crucially, would remain unlawful and intentionally ending the life of another person, even if it is for compassionate reasons, would continue to amount to murder.

United Kingdom criminal law does respect a person's autonomy to a certain degree, however. If V refuses medical treatment that will save their life, doctors who accede to that refusal are not responsible for the resulting death(s). Indeed, the doctors will be acting unlawfully if they override V's decision and operate. It was therefore unlawful for a doctor to perform an emergency caesarean on a woman without her consent, although it was necessary to save the life of both the woman and her unborn child (St George's Healthcare NHS Trust v S [1999] Fam 26).

7.1.3 A human victim

The law of criminal homicide protects only living humans. It is not criminal homicide to kill a foetus in the womb, although this may constitute the separate offence of abortion or child destruction. A criminal homicide also cannot be charged if the acts are directed against a person already dead. Therefore, two issues need to be considered: first, when does life begin, and second, when does life end?

Topic 7 - Reflective activity 1

## Learning activity 1
Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 13.3.A.3 'In being' and then answer the following questions.

What test do the courts apply in deciding whether the victim's life had begun at the time of the unlawful act in question?
â—‹ The child had left the birth canal and was breathing
â—‹ The child had left the birth canal and the umbilical cord was severed
â—‹ The child had left the birth canal and was capable of breathing and maintaining blood supply.
â—‹ The child's head had left the birth canal.


If D performs an abortion on herself which causes the child to be born alive but the child then dies because it is born prematurely, is a conviction for murder or manslaughter possible?
â—‹ Yes
â—‹ No

What test do the courts apply in deciding whether the victim's life had already ended at the time of the unlawful act in question?
â—‹ The individual had ceased breathing and their heart had stopped
â—‹ The individual was incapable of living in the absence of life sustaining therapy such as mechanical ventilation and cardio-pulmona support.
â—‹ The individual had suffered brain death.

## 7.2 Murder

We have examined the *actus reus* of murder, which is an unlawful killing of a human being. All that remains to be discussed of the basic elements is the mens rea.

### 7.2.1 Intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm

Traditionally, the fault element in murder is described as malice aforethought. However, it is better to forget this form of words, which was coined in an earlier, less definition-driven age. Neither malice nor premeditation is required. A killing done intentionally in the heat of the moment is just as much murder as one which has been planned and premeditated. An intentional killing is murder if prompted by compassion as much as if prompted by greed. So, in *Inglis* [2011] 1 WLR 1110, the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction for murder of a mother whose son was in a persistent vegetative state following a car accident and whom she had deliberately injected with heroin as an act of compassion.

The mens rea for murder is intention to kill (also known as express malice) or intention to cause grievous bodily harm (also known as implied malice). The mental state common to both these is intention.

### 7.2.2 What does intention mean?

We examined the meaning of intention in Topic 5 of this module quide. It means, in the context of murder, having death (or grievous bodily harm) as one's objective in acting as one did, such that, if death (or grievous bodily harm) did not occur, one would consider one's action a failure (Duff, 1990).

Occasionally, the judge will direct the jury that it is entitled to find intention in the absence of evidence of such 'direct' intention if, although it was not the actor's aim or objective to cause death (or grievous bodily harm), the jury considers that D knew either of these outcomes was virtually or morally certain. This is known as 'indirect' or oblique intention. As we have already covered in detail what intention means, in this topic you will see how it is used in practice.

Much of the criminal law is about the judge giving the right instruction to the jury. Many of the cases which you have encountered here and in Wilson and Lammasniemi, and will continue to encounter, are cases where the judge got this instruction wrong â€“ if only slightly â€“ which opened up the case to an appeal. I hope this makes you feel more comfortable about your own knowledge and understanding!

7.2.3 Directing the jury on the mens rea for murder

In the vast majority of cases, the judge must give the jury the **standard** direction, which does not define intention except to say that intention is different from motive. So, on the facts in Illustration 2, only a standard direction should be given.

#### **Illustration 2**

D, a gangster, stabs V through the abdomen in the course of a fight. V dies. D is charged with murder. D denies an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. He says it was an accident.

The standard direction will be something like this:

Members of the jury, to find the defendant quilty of murder the question you must ask yourself is: 'Did D stab V with the intention of killing V?' If you are not sure that he did have this intention then ask yourselves: 'Did D stab V with the intention of causing V serious injury?' If your answer to either of these questions is yes then you must find the accused guilty of murder. If you are not sure that he had either of these intentions but are sure that he did intend some harm then you may find him quilty of manslaughter.

Now assume the following facts.

#### **Illustration 3**

D sets fire to a house which he has just burgled to destroy any incriminating evidence which he may have left. He knows that the owner, V, is upstairs asleep in bed. V dies in the blaze.

Here there is evidence that D may well have had something else in mind other than death or grievous bodily harm when he set the house alight. The jury will, therefore, need some guidance as to whether it is entitled to convict D of murder given the extreme likelihood that death or serious injury would result from such an act. Only where, as here, the evidence strongly supports the possibility that D acted for a purpose other than to kill (or, for example, to frighten, to escape, to intimidate, to reduce pain suffered by the other) must the special direction be given. For example, here is a modified version of a judicial summing up for such a case provided for the Crown Court:

Members of the jury, you have been told that it was not D's intention in setting the house alight to kill the V or cause V serious injury but simply to remove incriminating evidence. The prosecution reject this and say that it was clearly D's intention to kill or cause serious injury to V. To decide what D's

intention was you need to consider what D did and said before, at the time of and after the incident, and then draw conclusions from your findings about these things. If you are sure that D's intention was to kill or seriously injure V, the prosecution will have proved the intention necessary for murder and your verdict will therefore be 'Guilty'. If, however, you accept that D may only have wanted to frighten V, you should then consider whether it was virtually certain that, unless something unexpected happened, what D did would cause V's death or really serious injury; and, if so, whether D realised that this was virtually certain. If, in the light of all the evidence, you are sure about these things, it would be open to you to conclude that D did intend to kill or seriously injure V, and your verdict would be 'Guilty'. Otherwise, the prosecution would not have proved the intention necessary for murder, and so your verdict would be not guilty of murder (but guilty of manslaughter).

(based on Woollin [1999] AC 82, per Lord Steyn at 87)

Most juries would convict of murder on the basis of such a direction, as they would no doubt consider grievous bodily harm in the form of serious burns at the very least to be a virtual certainty and be prepared to impute that knowledge to the defendant on the basis that if they know it then he knew it.

There are two important things to be noted about this direction. The first is that the direction does not instruct the jury that it is bound to find intention where there is foresight of certainty, only that it is entitled to. The second is that the direction tells the jury that it may not find the necessary intention unless the defendant foresaw the death or grievous bodily harm as virtually certain. Foresight of high probability is not enough. This would be sufficient only for manslaughter.

Now consider this example.

#### **Illustration 4**

D is caught in a blazing fire in the third-storey bedroom of her home with V, her three-year-old son. D panics, believing that they are both doomed unless they jump out the window. She pushes her son out of the window and then jumps herself. V dies in the fall; D survives.

Again, there is evidence that D had something else in mind other than causing death or grievous bodily harm when she threw V out of the window. Again, therefore, the jury will need some quidance as to whether it is entitled to convict D of murder given the extreme likelihood that death or serious injury would result from such an act. Again, the Woollin direction must therefore be given:

Members of the jury, you have been told that it was not D's intention in throwing V out of the window to kill V or cause V serious injury . Far from it, it was to save him. The prosecution reject this and say that it was clearly D's intention to kill or cause serious injury to V. To decide what D's intention was you need to consider the context in which D acted and what D did and said before, at the time of and after the incident, and then draw conclusions from your findings about these things. If you are sure that D's intention was to kill or seriously injure V, the prosecution will have proved the intention necessary for murder and your verdict will therefore be 'Guilty'. If, however, you accept that D's action was triggered by a desire to save V's life, you should then consider whether it was virtually certain that, unless something unexpected happened, what D did would cause V's death or really serious injury; and, if so, whether D realised that this was virtually certain. If, in the light of all the evidence, you are sure about these things, it would be open to you to conclude that D did intend to kill or seriously injure V. But, in order to reach this conclusion, you would, of course, have to decide whether D could intend to kill V and intend to save their life at the same time by the very same act of throwing V out of the window. If you consider this to be impossible, the prosecution would not have proved the intention necessary for murder, and so your verdict would be not guilty of murder.

A jury would probably not wish to convict of murder on the basis of such a direction, although it would no doubt still consider broken bones (grievous bodily harm) at the very least to be a virtual certainty and be prepared to impute that knowledge to the defendant on the basis that if they know it then she knew it.

The jury would probably not convict because of two aspects of the direction. The first, dealt with above, is that the direction does not instruct the jury that it is **bound to** find intention where there is foresight of certainty, only that it is **entitled to**. The second is that the direction tells the jury to reach its decision on the basis of all the evidence, taking into account what D was seeking to achieve. This form of words sends a pretty clear message to the jury that 'foresight of certainty' is not conclusive. With this message, the jury's natural humanity can be relied upon to reach the common-sense verdict of not guilty.

Note that if D is not quilty of murder, the jury should not bring in a verdict of manslaughter either, since, in effect, they are concluding that the killing was not done recklessly (justified risk taking), was not unlawful (no intention to harm/no recklessness) and was not grossly negligent (reasonable conduct in the circumstances).

Of course, there are other means of avoiding a conviction for murder here, namely the possibility of raising a defence of necessity, but the courts have set their face against developing a general defence of necessity to cover such cases, preferring to rely on the jury's good sense via the mens rea requirement.

Note: If D kills using a lethal weapon, poison or extreme violence, the standard direction will almost invariably be the correct one and Woollin should not be used.

### 7.2.4 What has to be intended?

It is important to remember that the mens rea for murder is either an intention to kill the victim or an intention to cause grievous bodily harm to the victim. This was made clear in Vickers [1957] 2 QB 664 and confirmed in Cunningham [1982] AC 566, in which the defendant repeatedly hit the victim over the head with a chair, which caused his death. The defendant appealed against his conviction for murder, arguing that Vickers was wrongly decided and an intention to kill was necessary. This was rejected and Vickers affirmed.

Show feedback

- 1. Serious or really serious physical injury.
- 2. The jury.
- 3. No.

### 7.2.5 Directing the jury: intentional violence

So how should the jury be directed in a case where, although D causes V's death by an act of intentional violence, the injury intended was not life threatening?

Consider the following example.

#### **Illustration 5**

D, a member of a criminal gang, decides to teach V, a member of a rival gang, a lesson. D takes an iron bar, smashes both V's kneecaps with it and leaves him in the street. V crawls along the pavement and tumbles onto the road, where he is killed by a passing car.

In this case, the prosecution has all it needs to gain a conviction for murder. It can prove both *actus reus* and causation. It also has strong evidence of a direct intention to cause V grievous bodily harm. It has no need to prove anything else. The trial judge will direct the jury as follows:

Members of the jury, to find the defendant guilty of murder, the question you must ask yourself is: 'Did D act with the intention of killing V?' If you are not sure that he did, then ask yourselves: 'Did D act with the intention of causing V grievous bodily harm?' Grievous bodily harm means really serious injury. So the first question you must ask yourself is whether the injuries to the kneecaps suffered by V amount to really serious injury. It is up to you to decide whether smashing both kneecaps is really serious injury for this purpose but I hardly need to advise you that the consequences of such an injury, although not life threatening, are likely to be long lasting and severe. If you find they amount to really serious injury, then the prosecution still has to prove that D intended to cause really serious injury. To decide what D's intention was you need to consider what D did and said before, at the time of and after the incident, and then draw conclusions from your findings about these things. So, first consider what D did. D used an iron bar. He applied it with sufficient force to break both kneecaps. The pathologist giving evidence said that severe force would have been needed to cause such an injury. However, D says that he only struck twice and in a half-hearted fashion. The pathologist suggested that this was improbable given the seriousness of V's injuries. When you have considered all of this, you must then decide, in the light of your findings, what D's intention was when he caused V's injuries.

### 7.2.6 Reforming murder

There is general dissatisfaction with the law relating to murder. The major problem from which all others derive is the mandatory life sentence. This means that a cold-blooded serial killer receives the same sentence as a caring spouse who performs euthanasia on a terminally ill partner, and the same sentence as someone (as in Illustration 5) who, intending only to cause serious injury, causes that person's death when others would have survived. Many commentators believe that the intention to cause serious injury should not be sufficient for murder, since it is a form of constructive liability; that is, liability for the greater crime (murder) is constructed out of the elements of a

lesser crime (causing grievous bodily harm with intent). This is a breach of the correspondence principle (see Topic 6 of this module guide) and, given the mandatory life sentence for murder, it is a gross breach. See, for example, Lord Steyn's speech in Powell and Daniels [1999] 1 AC 1.

## Mini lecture 1 - **What's wrong with murder**

Prof William Wilson, Criminal law

What's wrong with murder? This lecture covers many of the perceived problems surrounding the law of murder, its fault element and the mandatory sentence. There are others. We will deal with these another time. Let's turn first to the fault element. The fault element in murder is an intention to kill or intention to cause grievous bodily harm. These are alternate fault elements.

If the prosecution cannot prove the defendant intended to kill the deceased, a conviction may still occur if it can prove the defendant intended the deceased to suffer serious injury through his act. What are the problems surrounding murder? The first problem concerns what it is to intend to kill someone or cause them serious injury. A person intends to kill or cause serious injury if that was their purpose. However, intention carries a second meaning in criminal law.

A person who acts knowing for certain that death will result barring a miracle may be found by the jury to have intended that consequence although this was not their purpose. A woman who blows up her house with her husband still inside so as to claim on the household insurance policy may be found to have intended her husband's death although she dearly hoped he would survive. Good, you may think she was wicked but the problem runs deeper than this. The jury are told that they are entitled to find intention if the evidence supports this conclusion but they're not bound to.

Suppose the reason for blowing up the house was that a fire was spreading to a nearby town and that this was the only way to stop the spread and save many lives. The husband still dies but the lives are saved. The jury now has a dilemma. Was the husband's death intended or not given the evidence? The judge cannot help them. It is the jury's decision and different juries are likely to reach different decisions on the same evidence. In one case, the wife is acquitted of murder. In another she is convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. This is hardly just.

Let's move on to the second problem. We naturally think of a person who intentionally kills another as wicked. More wicked perhaps than someone who does so recklessly but think more closely and you'll understand that this is not necessarily so. Some intentional killers, for example, a mercy killer of a loved one with a terminal illness is not wicked at all and yet she is guilty of murder. On the other hand, Mrs. Hayan, who without intending death or serious injury recklessly set fire to a house knowing it was occupied is very wicked and yet she is guilty only of manslaughter.

Are these conviction labels just? Should certain killers who deliberately expose others to the risk of death not come within the fold, umbrella of murder while our mercy killer is given at least a partial defense? Remember again, the judge has no discretion as to the sentence she imposes. This brings us to the third problem, which the mandatory sentence. If some reckless killers are more wicked than some intentional killers, should judges not have a sentencing discretion? Most commentators and judges think so but parliament will not be moved.

The fourth problem concerns the intention to cause grievous bodily harm as the fault element in murder. This renders murder a form of constructive liability. That is the mens rea for a lesser crime is sufficient for a greater crime. This is a problem because it contradicts the principle that criminal liability requires the actus reus and mens rea to correspond with each other. If the actus reus is causing death then the mens rea in principle should be an intention to cause death or at the very least foresight of death.

There have been suggestions that grievous bodily harm should mean life endangering harm but in Vicars, the House of Lords said that a person is guilty of murder when with intention of committing only grievous bodily harm the victim dies. The prosecution do not have to prove that death was foreseen. GBH murder does have some support. For example, John Gardner argues that an intention to cause serious harm crosses a moral threshold at which point the defendant is responsible for creating his own bad luck. In other words, no one can predict whether serious injury will result in death.

It's the kind of thing which sometimes happens. Therefore those who set out to attack other people to accuse them serious harm must take the consequences even if they're more serious than expected. On which side of the line do you stand or would you as many do say that all these problems would disappear if the judge had a sentencing discretion to take account of the circumstances under which the victim met his death?

The fifth problem, grievous bodily harm means serious harm but what counts as serious harm. It has not been defined. In fact, it is for the jury to decide whether the harm be intended to cause the victim was serious or not. In deciding this they will take into account the nature of the injury and the age and characteristics of the victim but the bottom line is a person could be guilty of murder if he attacked him intending only to give him a serious beating or break his leg. If fate takes a hand and the victim happens to die whether he's convicted or not depends again on the jury whether they think that injury intended was serious or not. Again, different juries may reach different conclusions and this is not just.

Finally, if there's so many problems, how could the position be improved? The Law Commission these problems by making certain proposals for reform. Its recommendations provide a two-tier system which allows both offense label and sentence to match the degree heinousness displayed in the particular killing. The final slides outline the Law Commission's thinking on murder and the boundary with manslaughter.

For full discussion see Wilson 13.4 B1. I shall not talk to these slides because they follow on from the criticisms I've been discussing. However, it is very important that you examine these carefully because you will see that most of the problems I have discussed are addressed in these sets of proposals including the mandatory sentence. As usual, however, parliament has taken very little notice. Turn now and take careful notes.

## Mini lecture 2 - MURDER'S PARTIAL DEFENCES

Murder's Partial Defences. All the general defences except duress apply to murder. These include self-defence, necessity, insanity, and automatism. Murder also has two special defences. A conviction for murder carries a mandatory life sentence. To mitigate the harshness of this rule, these defences have been created a certain killers thought to lack full responsibility for their crime. The effect is to reduce what would otherwise have been a murder conviction to manslaughter. This allows the judge full sentencing discretion. These special defences are loss of control, which used to be known as provocation, and diminished responsibility.

The first special defence is loss of control. A defendant who kills due to losing their self-control may raise the defence of loss of control if they are the subject of acts or words, which fall under what the act called a qualifying trigger. Assuming that this qualifying trigger is present, the defence is available if people of normal tolerance might have been expected to react in the same way.

The elements of this defence are then threefold. One, there must be a loss of control. Second, this loss of control must be triggered by what is termed a qualifying trigger. Third, the defendants' reaction must not be out of line with what might be expected of people of normal tolerance faced with a similar trigger.

Loss of Control. Loss of control does not simply mean loss of temper, it means losing the ability to control one's action, as in the phrase, "He completely lost it." This distinction between loss of control and loss of temper was made in the case of doors.

The second requirement is that the loss of control is induced by a qualifying trigger. The Coroners and Justice Act places limits on what triggers the defendant can rely on to justify losing control. By section (55(1)) of the Coroner's and Justice Act 2009, there are two qualifying triggers. First, the fear of serious violence against D or another person. Or B, thing said or done which, one, are extremely grave, and two, induced D to believe he had been seriously wronged, which belief was, in the circumstances, justifiable.

The first trigger is designed to deal with those who, fearful for their safety or the safety of others, overreact in the heat of the moment. It complements in this respect, the defence of self-defence is appropriate for the victim of cumulative domestic violence, who finally cracks and kills their abuser. Also, a person who encounters an armed burglar in their house panics and shoots him dead. In both cases, the killer will probably not be able to rely on self-defence because the killing is disproportionate, but they may be able to rely on loss of control.

The second trigger refers to very seriously provocative words or acts. Under the old law of provocation, the equivalent trigger was not so restrictive. It could be used to justify killing in cases of infidelity, killing a nagging partner, or even killing a baby who was persistently crying. Such trivial triggers can no longer be relied upon. The trigger must objectively be extremely grave, leading a person to believe justifiably that they have been seriously wronged. So for example, a person who

is wrongly accused of a serious crime, or someone who is being blackmailed, for a shameful event in their past, might be able to rely on this trigger. So also might a parent who killed someone who had, in the past, abused or hurt their child.

On the other hand, a person who finds their partner in bed with another person will not be able to rely on the trigger. This partial defence of loss of control is only available if the defendant's reaction is consistent with what might be expected of ordinary decent citizens with normal levels of tolerance. It acts then as a concession to ordinary human weakness. The idea is that most of us will crack under the right provocation.

Apart from losing self-control, another reason why a person may lack a degree of responsibility for intentional killing is if they suffer from a mental condition, which induce them to act as they did. This forms the basis for the second partial defence to murder which is diminished responsibility.

It is important that you understand the difference between these two defences. It is also important to understand the difference between this defence and insanity. Section two of the Homicide Act of 1957 provides the three requirements for this defence. First, the defendant must have suffered from a recognized medical condition from which their mental abnormality arose.

Second, this abnormality of mental functioning must have substantially impaired the defendant's ability to think rationally and or understand what he was doing and or exercise self-control. Thirdly, it must explain or partially explain why the defendant killed the victim.

The first element in diminished responsibility is a recognized medical condition. This slide gives a few examples of conditions which have been recognized by the courts as a basis for defence. Note in particular, voluntary drunkenness may cause mental abnormality resulting in a killing, but it is not a recognized medical condition for the purpose of the act. On the other hand, chronic alcoholism is a recognized medical condition and so can be relied upon. To understand the difference between these make sure you read topic 7.3.3.

The second element in the defence is substantial impairment. Note that there are three routes to establishing the defence. There must be substantial impairment of understanding or a substantial impairment of rational judgment or a substantial impairment of self-control or a combination of one or more of these factors. When you have a problem in front of you, you must look at the facts to see which, if any, of these faculties have been impaired. Is it understanding? Is it rational judgment? Is it self-control? Or is it a combination? It is not enough that the defendant suffered a mental abnormality rising from a medical condition, which impair their ability to think or control themselves properly. It must provide at least a partial explanation for the killing. The idea is that even people with low levels of rationality or self-control, they sometimes kill simply because they want to and in such a case, no defence should be available.

Here is a case study, case called Regina against Blackman. D soldier, while in action in Afghanistan, shot dead an unarmed prisoner who was a member of the Taliban. He was charged with murder. His defence was diminished responsibility. He claimed he was suffering from combat stress, which induced in him a hatred of the Taliban and a desire for revenge. So, can he rely on this defense of diminished responsibility?

The first question is whether combat stress is a recognized medical condition? Secondly, if it is, the second question is, did this recognized medical condition lead to a substantial impairment of the ability to understand what he was doing, and/or form of rational judgment, and/or exercise selfcontrol?

The court-martial appeals court held relying on evidence given by psychiatrists that his medical condition of combat stress was a recognized one and that this substantially impaired his ability to form a rational judgment. And finally, they decided that this condition explained why he killed.

That concludes this mini-lecture on partial defences to murder. Please now return to your reading on Topic 7.

## 7.3 Voluntary manslaughter

Apart from the general defences, murder is served by three special (partial) defences which, if successful, reduce a murder conviction to a conviction for voluntary manslaughter. It is called voluntary manslaughter because the prosecution can prove the killing was voluntary (in the sense of being intended or almost intended), but the context provides a degree of mitigation which would render the mandatory sentence unjust. We shall be covering here two of these partial defences, namely loss of control (known as provocation until 2010) and diminished responsibility.

### 7.3.1 Provocation

Provocation was relevant to killings that took place before 4 October 2010, when this partial defence was abolished and replaced with that of loss of control under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. It will therefore be dealt with very briefly here. It is similar in structure to loss of control, and many of the principles underlying it are similar to those underlying the new defence, so it is useful to read this section carefully.

Provocation had a subjective and an objective element. The subjective element was that the killing should have resulted from a loss of self-control triggered by provocative deeds or actions. Loss of self-control not triggered by another's deeds or actions was not covered by the defence (Acott [1996] 4 All ER 443). The requirement of loss of self-control excluded revenge, and other premeditated killings, from the ambit of the defence (Ibrams (1982) 74 Cr App R 154). It was long thought that this meant that the defence could not be relied upon if there was a time lapse between the last incident of provocation and the killing (Duffy [1949] 1 All ER 932). In Ahluwalia [1992] 4 All ER 889, it was said that, although provocation required a loss of self-control, it did not necessarily follow that it should be by way of **immediate** reaction. In particular, a woman subject to cumulative domestic abuse might lose her selfcontrol after a period of 'slow burn', simmering anger which erupts long after the last provocative event. So long as the killing was by way of loss of self-control, and not revenge or premeditation, the defence remained available.

The objective element was that the defendant's conduct should be consistent with that of reasonable people faced with a similar trigger. In deciding this question, the jury was to take into account any characteristics of the defendant which made the acts or words of the provoker provocative â€“ for example, their race, size, weight, colour, hair colour, habits or sexuality, if this was the target of the provocation. The jury was not to take into account any characteristic which may have reduced the defendant's self-control below that of reasonable people (e.g. their intoxication, mental illness, excitable or aggressive temperament).

### 7.3.2 Loss of control

The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 retains the overall structure of provocation but restricts its application considerably by limiting the kind of triggers upon which the defendant can rely to ground their loss of self-control. Under the previous law, defendants had successfully used the defence in many cases thought to be undeserving: for example, loss of self-control triggered by a crying infant, a nagging partner or, most commonly, an unfaithful partner. This is no longer possible. The new defence requires the defendant's conduct to be partially justified by the context. It is not enough, in other words, that they (perhaps understandably) simply 'lost it'.

Section 54 of the act states the guiding principles of the new defence:

- Where a person ('D') kills or is a party to the killing of another ('V'), D is not to be convicted of  $murder$  if  $$ 
  - a. D's acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing resulted from D's loss of selfcontrol.
  - b. the loss of self-control had a qualifying trigger, and
  - c. a person of D's sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint and in the circumstances of D, might have reacted in the same or in a similar way to D.
- For the purposes of subsection  $(1)(a)$ , it does not matter whether or not the loss of control was sudden. [Emphases added].

The subjective element

Like provocation, the defence contains a subjective hurdle requiring a loss of (self-) control, which is caused by what is termed a qualifying trigger.

The concept of loss of control is not straightforward. What is it to lose self-control? In Duffy [1949] 1 All ER 932, decided under the old law, Devlin J gave the classic definition as involving the accused being 'so subject to passion as to make him or her for the moment not master of his or her mind'. In other words, loss of self-control is not simply a loss of temper. It requires the defendant literally to be rendered unable to control themselves. The fact that the killing appears frenzied or disproportionate is not in itself sufficient evidence of this (R v Goodwin [2018] EWCA 2287). It follows from the requirement that the defendant killed while out of control that a revenge killing cannot ground the defence. This is in fact made explicit in s.54(4), which states that the defence is not available 'if, in doing or being a party to the killing, D acted in a considered desire for revenge'. But, incorporating Ahluwalia, the loss of self-control does not have to be sudden. As Ahluwalia made clear, it is quite possible for a loss of control to occur in certain cases, such as those involving cumulative domestic abuse, even if there is a significant delay between the abuser's last act and the victim's reaction. However, the judge should always direct the jury that, as a matter of pure evidence, the longer the time lag between the trigger and the killing, the less likely it is

that the killing is attributable to D's loss of self-control. In two recent cases, heard together, the defence was held not available where the killings, although clearly influenced by the consequences of the break-up of relationships, were premeditated and considered rather than spontaneous (R v Dawes and Hatter [2013] EWCA Crim 322).

As has been explained, to rely on loss of control, the trigger must be sufficiently serious to justify the loss. There are two such 'qualifying' triggers.

#### First qualifying trigger

The first qualifying trigger is fear of serious violence. Specifically, it operates where 'D's loss of self-control was attributable to D's fear of serious violence from V against D or another identified person' (S.55(3)). A typical scenario covered by this trigger is the person who, after a period of cumulative violence, snaps and kills their tormentor (see Ahluwalia, above). Read together with s.54(1) and (4), the fear must trigger a loss of self-control rather than, say, a desire to be avenged or a rational decision to put an end to an ongoing source of torment. This qualifying trigger would also cover cases such as Clegg [1995] 1 AC 482 and Martin (Anthony) [2001] EWCA Crim 2245 (see Topic 11), where the respective defendants killed wrongdoers in circumstances where there was reason for fear but no good reason for what the court concluded was an (over)reaction to that fear. In both cases, the defendant's claim would be something to the effect that, 'In the heat and stress of the moment I was so fearful of the prospect of myself (or my colleagues/family) being killed or seriously hurt that I just lost my ability to control myself.'

As may be appreciated, the kind of scenario in which this trigger operates is the same kind of scenario that might also generate a plea of self-defence. The latter defence requires the defendant's use of force to be reasonable and proportionate. The former does not. In practice, because a successful raising of self-defence is a total defence, a person who kills in the context of violence used or threatened against them or another is likely to prefer raising this defence, either in addition to or in substitution for loss of control. If they fail with self-defence, the court may allow the evidence raised in support of this defence, if it is sufficiently compelling, to be considered by the jury in relation to the alternative defence of loss of control  $(R \vee \text{Goodwin}$  [2018] EWCA 2287).

#### **Illustration 6**

W comes across H viciously beating C, their infant child. W loses control and stabs H through the heart with a kitchen knife, killing him.

There are two defences W can run here. The first is self-defence, which is available (like loss of control) where another person is subject to the attack or threatened attack. The second is loss of control. By raising the evidence needed to run self-defence, W may avail herself of loss of control if, for example, the jury reject the former defence on the ground that the force used was unreasonable and/or disproportionate.

#### Second qualifying trigger

The second qualifying trigger, under s.55(4), operates where:

- ...D's loss of self-control was attributable to a thing or things done or said (or both) which-
- (a) constituted circumstances of an extremely grave character, and
- (b) caused D to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged.

This is the more usual trigger relied upon to raise loss of control, reflective of the kind of triggering event relied upon under the previous law of provocation. It poses two questions.

- 1. Is the loss of self-control attributable to things said or done which constitute circumstances of an extremely grave character?
- 2. Did these extremely grave circumstances cause D to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged?

The first question is designed to filter out trivial triggers, such as 'nagging', crying babies and sexual jealousy, because they do not constitute circumstances of an 'extremely grave character'. Sexual infidelity is in fact explicitly excluded from the range of qualifying triggers by s.55(6) (see below).

There are two components to the second question. The trigger must cause D to feel seriously wronged. If D would have killed anyway, the trigger is inoperative (see also the discussion of s.55(6) below). In addition, D must be justified in feeling that they have been seriously wronged. It will normally follow from being the subject of an extremely grave provocation that a person's sense of being seriously wronged is justifiable.

But not always. In Bowyer [2013] EWCA Crim 322, D, who was known to V, was discovered burgling V's flat. V, in his anger, made some extremely insulting comments about D's girlfriend, whereupon D lost his self-control and killed V. The Court of Appeal confirmed that the defence was not available, since D's status as a burglar destroyed his claim that he was justified in thinking he was being seriously wronged.

Other restrictions on the use of the qualifying triggers

Section 55(6) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 states:

In determining whether a loss of self-control had a qualifying trigger -

(a) D's fear of serious violence is to be disregarded to the extent that it was caused by a thing which D incited to be done or said for the purpose of providing an excuse to use violence;

(b) a sense of being seriously wronged by a thing done or said is not justifiable if D incited the thing to be done or said for the purpose of providing an excuse to use violence...

#### **Explanation**

If D is at fault in causing V to use violence  $-$  for example, D strikes the first blow, or says or does something provocative (e.g. commits a sexual assault on V) which triggers a violent or otherwise abusive reaction from  $V - D$ is not disabled from using V's conduct as a qualifying trigger (Johnson [1989] 1 WLR 740). However, if D does so in order to give themself an excuse to kill V when V retaliates, then D is disabled. This was confirmed in Bowyer [2013] EWCA Crim 322. While it is more common for loss of control to happen after V says or does something that acts as a trigger, it is not a necessary requirement. Therefore, something said and/or done by a third party could provide the trigger, as  $R \vee M$ yles [2023] EWCA Crim 943 demonstrates.

#### **Sexual infidelity**

Under the old law of provocation, one of the most common triggers, in line with the defence's heavily gendered nature, was sexual jealousy and possessiveness. The new law seeks to remove gender bias from the defence by ensuring that emotions such as sexual jealousy and unjustified anger are no longer qualifying triggers. Only justified loss of self-control is covered.

To make sure no judge was under any illusions that sexual jealousy was a qualifying trigger, s.55(6) explicitly excludes it. Now, a person who kills because they witness or hear about the sexual infidelity of their partner cannot use the defence. In Clinton, Parker and Evans [2012] EWCA Crim 2, an important qualification was made by the Court of Appeal. In effect, *Clinton* interprets s.55(6) to mean that sexual infidelity which prompts a loss of selfcontrol due to sexual jealousy, possessiveness or family honour is not a qualifying trigger. However, if the sexual infidelity provides the context within which another trigger operates, it must be considered.

In Clinton, D killed his wife having found out she was unfaithful. However, the loss of self-control was not prompted by possessiveness or jealousy but by the fact that, when asked to reconsider her wish to leave D, she abused him and made several extremely wounding remarks â€“ including that she had had enough of looking after their children - and derided him for being too weak-minded to execute his desire to commit suicide. Thus, taking the whole

context into account, including the infidelity, D was able to claim that he was subject to things said or done which constituted circumstances of an extremely grave character and caused him to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged.

Since Clinton, there have been other cases in which defendants have killed following a discovery of sexual infidelity. These have not been presented as cases where the killing was triggered by jealousy, but rather, as in Clinton, as ones where infidelity was one of a number of events which, cumulatively, constituted circumstances of an extremely grave character. In Dawes, Hatter and Bowyer [2013] EWCA Crim 322, the Court of Appeal, although approving the decision in Clinton, agreed with the trial judge that the break-up of a relationship, in itself, will not normally constitute circumstances of an extremely grave character and entitle the aggrieved party to feel a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged. As a result, the appellants' convictions were upheld. The following statement of the trial judge in Hatter explains the decision:

To suggest that the fact of a break-up of a relationship could amount to circumstances of an extremely grave character or that it would entitle the aggrieved party to feel a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged would be to ignore the normal meaning of these words. It would also result in the defence of loss of control being left to the jury in almost every case where one partner to a relationship kills the other, which was clearly not Parliament's intention.

There must, in other words, be something, as happened in *Clinton*, in addition to the usual heartache and grievances accompanying the break-up of a relationship which renders the circumstances sufficiently grave to warrant a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged.

#### The objective element

In keeping with the old law of provocation, the new partial defence also contains an objective element. Under  $s.54(1)(c)$ , the reaction of the defendant must be consistent with what might be expected of ordinary people of D's sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint and in the circumstances of D. In  $R$   $\vee$ Willcocks (2016), the question for the court on appeal was whether a personality or mental disorder of the defendant was one of the circumstances the jury should take into account in deciding whether the defendant's reaction was to be expected. The Court of Appeal said that the trial judge was right to refuse to allow this to be taken into account, since the only relevance of this disorder was that it reduced the defendant's powers of selfrestraint. The circumstances that the jury are able to take into account are circumstances to which any ordinary person may be subject (e.g. their race, religion, gender, sexual preference, physical appearance, past events and experience).

Another way of saying this is that it disqualifies the defendant from relying on the defence if their reaction was triggered not by an external element but by a character flaw, such as being unusually intolerant or aggressive, or being intoxicated (Asmelash [2013] EWCA Crim 157) and so less able to control themselves. People are expected to keep to the same standards of self-control as other ordinary people. If the individual has some condition or characteristic that reduces their ability to exercise self-control, such as a mental illness or abnormality, they would be better advised to rely on the defence of diminished responsibility. The only inherent features that might effect this objective standard are age, presumably because the young are more likely to be hot-headed, and sex, for less obvious reasons.

#### Evidence and procedure

The relative functions of judge and jury are described in s.54(5) and (6) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009:

(5) On a charge of murder, if sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue with respect to the defence under subsection (1), the jury must assume that the defence is satisfied unless the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt that it is not.

(6) For the purposes of subsection (5), sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue with respect to the defence if evidence is adduced on which, in the opinion of the trial judge, a jury, properly directed, could reasonably conclude that the defence might apply.

As is usual in relation to defences, the burden of (dis)proof is on the prosecution. As is also usual, this burden of proof does not kick in unless D adduces evidence capable of leading the jury to conclude that the defence applies  $(s.54(5))$ . The judge decides whether the evidence so adduced by the defendant is so capable  $(s.54(6))$ . The judge would, therefore, disallow any evidence that the defendant lost their self-control due to intoxication, sexual jealousy, their partner's nagging, their baby crying and so on. If, however, the defendant's evidence was, for example, that their partner had threatened them or the child with injury or had been taking family money to support a lover or a business venture or had been accused of some disgraceful act â€“ that is, anything which is capable of being viewed as extremely serious, the judge should permit the jury to consider this evidence to determine whether the defence should succeed. In each case, the judge must review the evidence before deciding whether it is strong enough to put before the jury. As the Court of Appeal said in Dawes, Hatter and Bowyer, this is not a matter of judicial discretion, but rather a matter of judgment that is either right or wrong. Nevertheless, as was explained in this case and reaffirmed in Martin [2017] EWCA Crim 1359, the Court of Appeal will be slow to interfere with the trial judge's judgment on this matter, as they have heard the evidence first hand. It recently confirmed in R v Myles [2023] EWCA Crim 943 that the defence must show sufficient evidence of all the three elements of the loss of control defence, i.e. a loss of self-control on D's part, a qualifying trigger, and the reaction

of a person of D's sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint before it can be put to the jury. In Myles, the trial judge refused to direct the jury on the loss of control defence, on the basis that there was no evidence of Myles having had a loss of control. The CA confirmed the judge was correct in was correct in not allowing the defence to the put to the jury as one element was missing.

#### **Study task 4**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 13.5.A.2 'The elements of the defence', Section (a) (ii) 'The Qualifying Triggers' and (iii) Sexual Infidelity and answer the following questions:

- 1. A accuses B of being a paedophile. B loses self-control and kills A. Assuming this insult constitutes circumstances of 'an extremely grave character', under what circumstances, if any, would B's sense of being seriously wronged not be justifiable?
- 2. V imprisons X in order to prevent X from executing his plan to harm Y. X loses control and kills V in outrage at his being imprisoned. Consider whether the defence of loss of self-control is available to X?
- 3. Eve discovers her husband, Adam, having sex with Ruth, who is Eve's daughter and Adam's step- daughter. Eve loses self-control and kills Adam. Consider whether or not the defence of loss of self-control excluded under s.55(6)? What authority can you provide to support your answer?

#### Show feedback

- 1. If the accusation was true.
- 2. Very unlikely. The judge would have to decide whether D's sense of being seriously wronged was justifiable which it is not.
- 3. Not automatically excluded. The judge would make a careful assessment based on the context and circumstances including Ruth's age when deciding if defence is excluded. They would rely on *Clinton* to consider whether sexual infidelity was the context rather than the trigger.

### 7.3.3 Diminished responsibility

Diminished responsibility originated in s.2 of the Homicide Act 1957. As with provocation, its purpose was to provide a sentencing discretion in cases of murder where serious mitigation exists. This was particularly important since, at the time, murder was a capital offence.

The defence was reconfigured by  $s.52$  of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009  $\vec{a}$ . The major changes made were to clarify the type of mental abnormality which may ground the defence, and the mechanism for substantiating that abnormality. Beyond this, the defence covers much the same ground, and so pre-2009 cases are likely to remain good authority where consistent with the new provisions. It should be noted that, unusually â€“ and contrary to the position with loss of self-control - the burden of proof is on the defence. The standard of proof is the civil standard: that is, on the balance of probabilities.

Section 52 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 amends s.2(1) of the Homicide Act 1957, as follows:

(1) A person ('D') who kills or is a party to the killing of another is not to be convicted of murder if D was suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning which -

(a) arose from a recognised medical condition.
(b) substantially impaired D's ability to do one or more of the things mentioned in subsection (1A), and
(c) provides an explanation for D's acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing.

 $(1A)$  Those things are -

(a) to understand the nature of D's conduct;
(b) to form a rational judgment;
(c) to exercise self-control.

We will now look at the elements of diminished responsibility.

Abnormality of mental functioning arising from a recognised mental condition

First, it must be established that the defendant suffered an abnormality of mental functioning. An abnormality of mental functioning is not defined but is traditionally regarded as an objectively significant deviation from what would be regarded as normal by a reasonable person. Obviously, this is a rather vague test, but is given focus by s.52(1A), which refers to its effect on D's ability:

- a. to understand the nature of D's conduct;
- b. to form a rational judgment;
- c. to exercise self-control.

So a person who kills because their abnormality of mental functioning causes them to misinterpret V's words or actions or causes them to interpret an innocent act as an aggressive act or causes them to see dangers where there are none, or to overestimate the danger they are facing, or who kills at the prompting of 'internal voices', or simply because their abnormality reduces their powers of self-control, comes within the defence, so long as this results from a recognised mental condition. In Salim y Public Prosecutor [2022] SGCA 6 F the Court of Appeal of Singapore decided (under the previous law of diminished responsibility that was still applicable in Singapore) that the defence was available even with respect to premeditated killings so long as, as in this case, the killer was able to prove that his abnormality of mental condition was such as to substantially impair his rationality (rational judgment) in coming to the decision to commit the murder.

#### Recognised mental condition

Under the old law, there was no requirement that the defendant's mental abnormality resulted from a recognised medical condition, as long as it was caused by some 'inherent' condition. This created a degree of flexibility, which is either a good thing or a bad thing, depending upon your point of view. Some of this flexibility has been removed. It is no longer possible, for example, for D to rely on the defence simply because they suffered chronic jealousy, or their powers of resistance had been worn down by the illness of a partner or child.

Recognised medical conditions can be found in authoritative classificatory lists, including the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases and the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. It is likely that the following conditions, which grounded the old law, will continue to be accepted as recognised mental conditions.

- Arrested or retarded mental development.
- Depression (Gittens [1984] QB 698).
- Bipolar (*Inglis* [2010] EWCA Crim 2637 **4**.
- Paranoid schizophrenia (Sutcliffe, The Times, 30 April 1981).
- Brain damage. (Hendy [2006] EWCA Crim 819; Wood [2008] EWCA Crim 1305).
- Psychopathy ( $B$ yrne [1960] 2 QB 396).
- Paranoid personality disorder (Martin (Anthony) [2001] EWCA Crim 2245).
- Postnatal depression (Reynolds [1988] Crim LR 679).

The law, therefore, will require the testimony of expert witnesses in any case where the condition relied upon by the defendant is contested or ambiguous. The case of Brennan [2014] EWCA Crim 2387 clarifies an important procedural issue in relation to the defence. If medical evidence supporting a defence of diminished responsibility is put before the court by a medical expert and the prosecution do not contradict that evidence with evidence of their

own medical expert, a charge of murder should be withdrawn from the jury. So, if the prosecution do not like the expert evidence put before the court by the defence, they should appoint their own medical expert to rebut it. Examples of contested conditions which were accepted as a basis for the defence under the old law include battered women's syndrome (Ahluwalia; Hobson [1998] 1 Cr App R 31) and premenstrual syndrome (Smith (Sandie) [1982] Crim LR 531). Nevertheless, the decision is ultimately one for the judge. In Osborne [2010] EWCA Crim 547  $\vec{c}$ , the Court of Appeal ruled that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) would not afford any ground for allowing the appeal against conviction on the basis of diminished responsibility.

#### Alcohol and drugs

The old law distinguished between binge drinking and chronic alcoholism. This separation is likely to be continued. Intoxication is not a 'medical condition' (Fenton (1975) 61 Cr App R 261); it will not, therefore, ground the new defence. In Dowds [2012] EWCA Crim 281, (2012) MHLO 18 L<sup>7</sup>, the Court of Appeal concluded that voluntary acute intoxication, whether from alcohol or another substance, is not capable of founding diminished responsibility. However, the abnormality of mental functioning does not have to be the sole cause of the killing so long as it 'provides an explanation' for D's participation in the killing. So a person who kills due to the combined effect of intoxication and a recognised mental condition may still have a defence (Dietschmann [2003] 1 All ER 897, disapproving Egan [1992] 4 All ER 470). In R v Kay [2017] EWCA Crim 647, the fact that the defendant, who suffered with schizophrenia, was unable to provide evidence that it was his schizophrenia that provided the trigger for the killing rather than the fact that he was acutely intoxicated at the time meant he was unable to rely on the defence. In other words, just because a person is schizophrenic does not mean that they can rely on the defence unless they can establish that the schizophrenia, rather than another trigger such as intoxication, was the cause of the psychotic episode.

One exception to this rule arises where the defendant is a chronic alcoholic. Under the old law, chronic alcoholism could ground the defence, as it was inherent to the defendant (Wood [2009] 1 WLR 496; Stewart [2009] 1 WLR 2507). This is still the law, since chronic alcoholism is a recognised medical condition and its injurious effect on the brain, which is well known, is to provoke irresistible cravings for alcohol and consequently a reduced capacity for self-control and forming rational judgements. Therefore, Mr Kay could have relied upon the defence if he had been able to establish that the psychotic episode arose from a combination of schizophrenia and chronic alcoholism. Unfortunately for him, he could not. He was just drunk.

Wood, above, is a typical case of this nature, involving a homeless alcoholic who, heavily intoxicated, killed an associate who had made a homosexual advance. The trial judge gave the misleading impression to the jury that the defendant's consumption of alcohol had to be entirely **involuntary** to count as an internal pathology capable of grounding the defence. The defendant's appeal was allowed for misdirection. The President of the Queen's Bench rejected the trial judge's proposition to the effect that 'unless every drink consumed that day by the appellant was involuntary, his alcohol dependency syndrome was to be disregarded'.

Which provides an explanation for the killing

The new provision requires that the abnormality must provide an explanation for the defendant's acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing. It must form part of the story as to why this killing took place: the defendant's reason was impaired, they did not fully understand what they were doing, or their self-control was lacking, and that is why â€“ or one of the reasons why â€“ they did what they did. A psychopath is, therefore, unlikely to be able to use this defence, since they lack neither ordinary powers of self-control nor normal cognitive abilities.

Section 52(1B) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 states that an explanation will be provided if the abnormality 'causes, or is a significant contributory factor in causing, D to carry out that conduct'. Whether it does provide an explanation for the killing is a question for the jury, which, in cases involving multiple causes â€“ for example, depression and intoxication (see Gittens) or chronic alcoholism and intoxication (see Wood) â€“ could prove a bit of a challenge.

#### Substantially impaired

The defence only operates if the mental abnormality substantially impaired D's ability to do one of the three things mentioned in s.52(1)(a). What does 'substantially' mean in this context? Does it mean a 'more than trivial impairment', i.e. having substance, or does it mean weighty and important?

In Golds (2014), the Court of Appeal preferred the second interpretation, ruling that the defendant's mental abnormality must have had a very significant effect on his ability to understand/control himself, etc. Whether the impairment crossed this threshold is a matter for the jury.

On appeal, the Supreme Court approved this ruling and dismissed Gold's appeal, stating that, for the purpose of diminished responsibility, 'substantially impaired' means 'something whilst short of total impairment is nevertheless significant and appreciable'.

#### Study task 5

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 13.6.B 'Statutory definition' and D 'Overlap with loss of self- control' and answer the following question.

Do the defences of loss of self-control and diminished responsibility adequately address the problem of battered partners who kill their abuser such as Ahluwalia and Challen?

##### Show feedback

Not entirely. Diminished responsibility requires a recognised mental condition and loss of self-control requires just that. No defence is available for someone who has just 'had enough' and kills their abuser because they can think of no other way out. Although Challen demonstrates that the courts are willing to consider impact of coercive and controlling behaviour.

## Lecture plus 1 - MURDER AND PARTIAL DEFENCES

Hello everyone and welcome to this Criminal Law Lecture Plus session. The topic today is Murder and Partial Defences. I am Dr. Laura Lammasniemi. I am the module convenor for Criminal Law. I look forward to talking through the key elements of homicide and partial defences. I also look forward to reading your responses to the Forum questions.

This lecture is divided into three parts. You can take a break between each part or listen to them at your own pace. The first part covers murder, focusing on its social and legal context. The second part discusses partial defences, specifically voluntary manslaughter and its applications. The final part previews a past exam question on this topic and discusses how to answer problem questions.

After listening to this lecture, I recommend you read deeper into the topic. Start with Chapter 7 of your module guide on the VLE, this focuses on homicide broadly. Then, read the relevant sections from your textbook, *Criminal Law* by Prof William Wilson and me, Laura Lammasniemi.

This graph illustrates the spectrum of homicide offences and specific partial defences to murder. That we will discuss in this lecture. It might seem overwhelming at first, but don't worry. We will break down each element of murder and partial defences. The key thing to remember is that under the umbrella of homicide, there are only two offences: murder and manslaughter. You might have seen TV series and films discussing terms like Murder One and Two or culpable homicide -these are US legal terms and do not apply in the UK. England and Wales has a two-tier structure for unlawful killing: murder, where the killing was intentional, and manslaughter, where the killing was not intentional but the defendant remains liable.

Before we discuss the social context of murder, let's go over the graph to illustrate the spectrum of homicide offences. The UK has a relatively simple homicide ladder with only two offences: murder and manslaughter. This simplicity can make the offences overly broad and sometimes difficult to operate.

We often think that life is so valuable that any taking of life should be dealt with utmost severity. However, this isn't always the case. Intentional killing, or murder, is harshly dealt with and is possibly the most serious crime. Manslaughter, on the other hand, isn't as harshly penalised. The sentencing tariff for manslaughter ranges from no custodial sentence to life imprisonment, typically between 2-10 years. These are significant differences considering that the legal and ethical boundaries between the two are not always clearly defined as I will go onto show.

In this lecture, we will focus on murder and the two partial defences: loss of control and diminished responsibility. These partial defences apply only to murder and, if successfully raised, reduce liability from murder to manslaughter.

Now, let's move on to the first substantive part of this lecture: murder.

Murder occupies a unique place in the public imagination. Numerous TV series, movies, and

podcasts are made about murder every year. Some are thrilling, others are reality TV, and some are just silly. There is also an entire genre of crime fiction in literature. Murder undoubtedly entertains people worldwide in various ways. Maybe you have a favourite crime series or movie?

Based on these films and books, you might think murder is everywhere. However, this isn't the case, and homicide rates in England and Wales are actually very low. In the past year (ending in 2024), police recorded 8.8 million crimes. Of these, just over 1.4 million were offences involving violence against the person, and there were 581 instances of homicide. This means that homicide and unlawful killings are a very small proportion of overall crime there negligible in percentage terms.

Although homicide offences are rare, thankfully so, they are not insignificant. We have already discussed the cultural fascination with murder. It is important to remember that it is of huge societal and personal importance. Having a loved one or family member murdered is horrific. Legally, it is also of great importance, and the possible reform of homicide laws has been considered for decades, leading to consultations by the Law Commission and numerous academic papers. But none have been acted on so far.

So we know that murder is important. But how then do we define murder in law? Firstly, it is important to remember that murder is a common law offence, meaning there is no statute that defines it. Instead, the definition has developed over hundreds of years. The traditional definition comes from Sir Edward Coke, who defined murder as:

"Murder is when a man of sound memory, and of the age of discretion, unlawfully killeth within any county of the realm any reasonable creature in rerum natura under the king's peace, with malice aforethought."

In modern terms, it is the unlawful killing of a human being under the King's peace with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm (GBH).

The actus reus of the definition is:

â€¢ Unlawfully causing the death of a human being in the King's peace.

The mens rea is:

â€¢ Malice aforethought, i.e., intention to kill or cause GBH. Traditionally, intent to kill was required for a murder conviction, but following the case of *Vickers* [1957] 2 QB 664, it has been expanded to include intent to cause GBH.

Let's unpack the actus reus in more detail. The actus reus is "unlawfully causing the death of a human being in the King's peace." The first key term is "unlawful," meaning the killing was not legally justified. For example, if it was a case of self-defence, the killing would be lawful and justified, and there would be no case to answer.

The second key term is "causing death." Understanding the rules of causation is essential, and they can take time to master. If you're unsure about the rules of causation, review them in your module guide.

The third aspect is that it must be the killing of a human being. Legally, life begins after birth. The child must be wholly expelled from the mother and have a separate existence from her, as established in the cases of *Poulton* (1832) and *Enoch* (1833). In other words, the foetus must be entirely out of the woman's body and take one breath independently before being considered a human being.

So, if life begins at birth, when does it end? Legally, life ends when the integrative action between the body's organs is irreversibly lost. The death of the brain or brain stem is a key indicator. In the case of Malcherek and Steel, the court stated that the test of death is the death of the brain stem. This was later confirmed and expanded in the House of Lords case of *Airedale NHS Trust v Bland* [1993].

The final aspect of the modern definition is that it applies in peacetime. During war, the killing of an enemy is not covered under ordinary rules of murder.

So, we have unpacked the actus reus: "unlawfully causing the death of a human being in the King's peace,".

Now that we have covered the actus reus, let's move on to the mens rea. The mens rea for murder is "malice aforethought," which means intent to kill or cause GBH. Traditionally, only intent to kill sufficed for a murder conviction, but in recent decades, it has been expanded to include intent to cause GBH.

Following Vickers, the modern definition of murder includes intent to kill as well as intent to cause GBH.

It is important to remember that nothing short of intent to kill or cause GBH will suffice for a murder conviction. There are two ways for juries to find intent: direct and indirect intent.

Direct intention is often straightforward and is left to the jury to find. It is often said to mean the same as the defendant's purpose or aim as for the case of Moloney. For example, if a person picks up a gun, aims it at the victim with the intention of killing them, and then pulls the trigger, resulting in the victim's death, there can be no question of intent. That is direct intent.

Indirect intent is more complicated. The primary intention of the defendant was to do something else, but as a consequence of their actions, the outcome was a virtual certainty. The current test for indirect intent comes from the case of *R v Woollin*. In this case, Woollin threw his 3-month-old baby onto a hard surface, causing a fractured skull and death. Woollin was initially convicted of murder. The trial judge directed the jury that if they were satisfied the defendant "must have realised and appreciated when he threw that child that there was a substantial risk that he would cause serious injury to it," then they could convict him of murder.

Woollin appealed his conviction based on misdirection. The Court of Appeal rejected his appeal, but it was successful in the House of Lords. The House of Lords substituted his murder conviction with a manslaughter conviction, stating that the judge's words on "substantial risk" were a material misdirection that expanded the mens rea of murder too far. In this case they clarified that the appropriate direction on indirect intent is. The court said and I will quote directly here. They said:

"*Where the charge is murder and in the rare cases where the simple direction is not enough, the jury should be directed that they are not entitled to infer the necessary intention unless they feel sure that death or serious bodily harm was a virtual certainty as a result of the defendant's actions and that the defendant appreciated that such was the case.*"

So from here, we learn that the current test for indirect intent is:

- 1. Death or serious bodily harm was a virtual certainty as a result of the defendant's actions.
- 2. The defendant appreciated that such was the case.

To sum up on the point of intent, it is crucial for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) must demonstrate that there was intent. There are two ways of forming this intent: direct intent and indirect intent.

Direct intent is where the defendant's aim or purpose was to kill or cause GBH.

Indirect intent is where the defendant's primary purpose or intention was to do something else, but death or serious bodily harm was a virtual certainty as a result of their actions, and the defendant appreciated this.

What makes murder so special and different from other crimes? We have already discussed the cultural and social fascination with murder, but even in law, there is something unique about it. Historically, an automatic death penalty was imposed for those found guilty of murder. Taking another's life was considered such a terrible crime that no punishment other than death was deemed sufficient. Today, the mandatory life sentence still exists, but it means life imprisonment, not death.

The automatic death penalty was abolished with the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 and replaced with mandatory life imprisonment. Under the European Convention on Human Rights, which you might of heard about in your other modules, the death penalty is also prohibited in member states, the UK is a member state. Life imprisonment can mean life with no possibility of release, in rare cases but most commonly, a tariff applies. Under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, judges should impose a minimum life tariff when they are sentencing. The minimum term, often 12, 15, 25, or 30 years, or a whole life tariff, must be served in full before the individual can be considered for release. After the minimum term, the Parole Board decides if the individual can be released. Even when released, convicted murderers are put on 'license' and can be recalled to prison at any time if conditions are breached.

Therefore, a person is never truly released, as they can be recalled to prison at any time, and a murder conviction is never spent. When applying for jobs, university, or anything else, they will always need to disclose this unspent conviction. The intentional killing of another person is often considered the worst of crimes, and the punishment reflects the severity and stigma attached to murder.

As mentioned earlier, we often think of murder as the worst of crimes. What could possibly be worse or more deserving of punishment than wilfully taking a life? However, both legally and morally, the concept of murder is complex. Sometimes, even an intentional killing may not warrant severe punishment, and public opinions on what constitutes intentional killing or murder may not align with the law.

When assessing whether someone is liable for murder, we must consider the reasons and circumstances surrounding the killing. In other words, why did the person do it? While motive isn't relevant to establishing intent, other factors might make the person less culpable. Were they unwell, perhaps suffering from psychosis at the time, or under the influence of substances? Maybe the person was acting in self-defence or they were in fear of their life?

I will provide four examples of such complex circumstances that can challenge the way we think about boundaries between murder and other forms of homicide.

The first example is that of an army on a battlefield. Generally, the intentional taking of a life is considered murder. However, this rule does not apply to the army during war or conflict. There is no liability for killingsâ€”intentional or unintentionalâ€”if they are part of the active war effort. Here,

killing is justified in law for the aim of war. Of course killings that fall outside the remit of war effort or battle can amount to murder or indeed manslaughter.

The second example is euthanasia and assisted dying. Taking steps to end the life of a terminally ill person is considered murder, even if the person consents and wants it to happen. Assisting someone to commit suicide is also an offence under the Suicide Act 1961. The law does not recognise consent or even desire to die as a mitigating factor in such cases and these cases are punished severely.

Here I want to introduce you to the case of Diane Pretty to illustrate the complexity of law in this area. Diane Pretty was a terminally ill woman who sought a declaration from the Crown Prosecution Service that her husband would not be prosecuted if he assisted her in dying. Euthanasia is not legal in England, so her husband would have been liable for murder if he took steps to end her life, even if it was something she wanted and requested. She was not granted the declaration she sought. The case went all the way to the European Court of Human Rights, but she was ultimately unsuccessful. Diane Pretty died, unassisted, shortly after the ECHR ruling.

Notably, recent opinion polls show that 84% of people in the UK support the legalisation of assisted dying in some form. An Assisted Dying Bill is currently going through Parliament, and we might see a change in the law in 2025. This Bill would decriminalise assisted dying in England and Wales, but crucially it would not legalise euthanasia. Under the Bill, doctors would be able to prepare the substance used to end the patient's life, but the person would be required to take the substance themselves. This Bill includes much needed safeguards. Only adults with mental capacity who are terminally ill and expected to die within six months would be eligible to request assisted dying. They must make two requests and satisfy two independent doctors and a High Court judge that they are eligible.

At the time of recording, the Parliament is debating the Bill and the Bill may or may not succeed. If it does, it would be a momentous change in law. I have included a link a recent blog on Laws VLE on this topic, and a question to reflect too on the Forum.

The third complicated example is Sally Challen. Sally was convicted of murdering her husband in 2010. Before the killing, Sally had spent years as a victim of domestic violence, controlled by her husband. In 2019, Sally successfully appealed her murder conviction. Her legal team argued that the coercive control and abuse she suffered provided a better framework for understanding her response and mental health issues at the time of the killing. At her retrial, her murder conviction was replaced with manslaughter, and she walked free due to time already served. This case shows that the courts and criminal law's understanding of factors that might lead someone to kill, such as domestic violence or indeed mental illness, evolve over time and changes.

The final example involves Valdo Calocane and his victims. In 2023, Calocane stabbed three people he did not know and drove a van into three others in Nottingham. He suffered from severe mental health problems and was convicted of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility. He was sentenced to indefinite detention at a high-security hospital and it might well be that he is never be released from that hospital. We will discuss diminished responsibility in the next section, but in this case, it was clear that both families, the press, and many members of the public thought the sentence was unduly lenient. Here, the law, even when appropriately applied, did not align with public opinion or the opinion of the press, who wanted these deaths to be punished more severely.

These examples highlight the complexities surrounding the ethical and moral issues of murder and the law. Before we move on to consider partial defences to murder, let's recap the key issues discussed in this first section. Firstly, Murder is regarded as one of the most serious crimes. However, despite its severity, there is no statutory definition of murder, but murder remains a common law offence and so you must know all the relevant cases to fully understand and apply it. Additionally, high-profile murder cases often highlight the ethical and moral ambiguities involved in prosecuting and sentencing this offence.

Now we will move on to consider partial defences to murder. You can take a break here if you wish, or continue listening. These defences are statutory and can be quite technical. It is important to bear in mind that partial defences to murder exist to mitigate the harshness of murder and its related sentencing. It is also important to remember that these partial defences came into existence at a time when the death penalty was the sentence to murder. Therefore, it was important to have mitigation to this charge.

As we start exploring partial defences to murder, I want to bring you back to the diagram we started with. Here, we see murder on the right-hand side and below it, voluntary manslaughter. Voluntary manslaughter covers scenarios where there has been an intentional killing, but the defendant relies on a partial defence. There are four partial defences: loss control, diminished responsibility, suicide pact, and infanticide. Suicide pact and infanticide are very very rare, so we will not focus on those in this lecture. Nor in your study materials. Instead, we focus on the two main defences: loss of control and diminished responsibility.

The effect of partial defences is that they reduce the charge from murder to manslaughter. They apply in situations where the defendant has both the actus reus and mens rea for murder and that they would ordinarily be liable for murder. If they can successfully raise one of these defences, their charge is reduced from murder to manslaughter. As you recall, murder carries a mandatory life sentence, whereas sentencing for manslaughter is discretionary. So, from the defendant's perspective, successfully pleading one of these defences can have a significant impact.

We will begin with loss of control. Loss of control used to be called provocation, and you might still hear it referred to as such or see it in some written materials. However, the correct legal term is 'loss of control' since the law changed in 2009. The law changed in 2009 for several reasons, mainly because it was perceived to be unfair to women. The old law of provocation was seen as more favourable to men and was often used by men who had killed their unfaithful spouses. It was considered that provocation better catered to men who were more likely to lose control, in an instant and become enraged than women were. This disparity was highlighted by cases like *R v Ahluwalia* (1993), where victims of domestic violence and abuse who killed their abusive husbands could rarely rely on the defence due to the requirement that the response had to be immediate.

So for these reasons law was changed and the new law came into existence in 2009. The law on loss control is governed by the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. Which is an important statute for you to know. The law is contained in sections 54 and 55. It is important to know these sections well and be able to apply them in problem questions. The partial defence of loss of control has three essential elements. When assessing whether the defendant could rely on the defence of loss of control, it is crucial to assess each of these elements in detail. Only if all three element are satisfied independently can the defence be successfully pleaded.

- 1. Did the defendant suffer a loss of control? (s.54(1)(a))
- 2. Was there a qualifying trigger? (s.54(1)(b))
  - "Fear" trigger s.55(3)
  - "Anger" trigger s.55(4)
  - Or a combination of both s.55(5)
- 3. Might a person of the defendant's sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and restraint, and in the circumstances of the defendant, have reacted in the same or a similar way? (s.54(1)(c))

We will now move on to think about these elements in detail.

First, the killing must have been the consequence of a loss of control under s.54(1)(a). This means that the defendant actually lost control; it doesn't mean that they can't recall what they didâ€”just that they could not control or contain themselves that particular in the moment. There are some qualifications here. For example, the killing or loss of control must not have been the result of a considered or desire for revenge. Unlike the old law, the loss of control no longer needs to be sudden, as explicitly mentioned in the statute. However, in the case of Jewell, it was noted that a long delay, particularly if premeditation occurred during that period, can count against the defendant having lost control.

Secondly, under s.54(1)(b), the loss of control must be linked to a qualifying trigger. There are two triggers under section 55: the so-called fear and anger triggers. The first trigger, often referred to as the fear trigger, states that losing control must be attributable to the defendant's fear of serious violence.

The second trigger is the anger trigger, which means that losing control must be attributable to things done or said that constituted circumstances of an extremely grave character and caused the defendant to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged.

The trigger can often also be the combination of the two.

The defendant's fear of serious violence or sense of being wronged should be ignored to the extent that it was self-induced, as confirmed in the case of R v Dawes. There is a second exclusion: anything done or said constituting sexual infidelity is also to be disregarded. In the past, provocation was known as the "jilted husband's defence." Many cases stemmed from husbands killing their wives or their wives' lovers after discovering an affair. The use of this defence was hugely controversial, and one of the key motivations behind the change in law was to remove this loophole that allowed men who killed their wives to receive lesser penalties.

However, sexual infidelity is not completely excluded since the case of *R v Clinton* [2012] EWCA. In Clinton, the appellant had been convicted of the murder of his wife. They had separated, and at the time of the killing, Clinton was experiencing difficulties at work and suffering from depression. He had hoped to reconcile with his wife, but she told him one night that the marriage was over. She also detailed multiple affairs she had and mocked him for being unable to commit suicide. He killed her violently, took photos of her naked body in various poses, and texted them to her lover. After his conviction for murder, he appealed, arguing that loss of control should have been introduced to the jury as a possible defence. Interestingly, here the Court of Appeal agreed. They said relationship breakdowns are "fraught with tension and difficulty, misunderstanding, and potential for irrational fury." Following Clinton, the rule is that sexual infidelity is still excluded as a sole trigger. However, if there is an alternative trigger, it can be discussed and introduced to the jury. In

Clinton's case, the trigger was her mocking him over his failure to commit suicide and taunting him, but infidelity formed part of a wider package relevant to that trigger. Therefore the court said it should have been allowed for the jury.

The third element of the defence is that there must be evidence that a person of the defendant's sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint, and in the circumstances of the defendant, might have reacted in the same or a similar way. This means that the defence and the final element are judged on an objective standard. If the defendant was intoxicated during the offence or suffered from a mental health condition, this will not be considered when making this assessment.

In conclusion, the judge must be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to raise each of the three elements before the defence can be raised in court. If the judge is satisfied, it can be introduced, and the prosecution then has the burden to convince the jury beyond reasonable doubt that one or more elements are not present.

The defence of loss of control is interesting for many reasons. It has undergone a major review in recent years, resulting in the Coroners and Justice Act and the new definition. While the defence itself was reformed and technical aspects clarified, it remained a defence. Many people, however, questioned whether there should be such a defence at all. The key question here is why is there such a defence? Are killings emerging from a sudden falling out any less heinous than killings that were the product of premeditation?

If someone kills due to uncontrollable anger, why is that person less culpable than a person who kills out of revenge?

Another problem with the old law on provocation was the gender issues at its core. That I have already alluded too. It was overwhelmingly used by men, and women could rarely rely on it. Men and women often respond differently to situations of violence, extreme stress, and anger. Men's responsesâ€”at least stereotypicallyâ€”are more immediate and often impulsive, and the old law on provocation only worked in such circumstances. The defence was often used by men who had discovered their partners had been unfaithful and murdered them, but women who murdered their husbandsâ€”often following years of domestic abuseâ€”were unable to rely on it.

A case that illustrates this well is the case of Kiranjit Ahluwalia, one of the most ground-breaking cases involving physical violence. In 1989, Ahluwalia killed her husband by setting him on fire while he was sleeping. She had suffered years of violence and humiliation at his hands, including while she was pregnant. On the night of the killing, her husband had threatened to burn her face with a hot iron.

Despite raising a defence of provocation at trial, Ahluwalia was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. Upon appeal, it was acknowledged for the first time that although provocation required a sudden loss of control, in cases of domestic abuse, the defendant may lose control at the end of what they call a "slow-burn" reaction to prolonged provocation. Ahluwalia won her appeal against conviction, and at a retrial in September 1992, the court accepted her plea to the lesser charge of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Cases like Ahluwalia, and other women who could not rely on any defence after killing their abusive partners, were an important consideration when the law was changed. Aimed at bringing battered women within its ambit, the Coroners and Justice Act (CJA) removed the requirement that the loss of control had to be sudden (s.54(2)) and recognised 'fear of serious violence' as a qualifying trigger (s.55(3)). On the other hand, the requirement that only a 'justifiable sense of being seriously wronged' (s.55(4)) could constitute a qualifying trigger and the exclusion of sexual

infidelity as a qualifying trigger (s.55(6)(c)) clearly aimed at delegitimizing male feelings of possessiveness over women.

There were clear attempts to bring gender parity within the reformed defence. However, it is questionable if the reform has been successful. For example, the exclusion of sexual infidelity as a qualifying trigger has been severely watered down by the case of R v Clinton (2012), discussed earlier.

The practical effect of Clinton is that sexual infidelity can now be included again if it forms part of a larger context for the qualifying trigger but it cannot be excluded as a sole factor. While it would be easy to blame the courts for reintroducing sexual infidelity as a qualifying trigger, Clinton responds to the fact that the exclusion of 'sexual infidelity' created too many arbitrary distinctions for it to be a workable legal criterion without actually defining what was meant to be unfaithful in a relationship.

Moving on from loss of control to diminished responsibility (DR). DR is another important partial defence. It functions exactly the same way as loss of self-control in that if it is successful, the charge is reduced from murder to manslaughter.

DR differs greatly from loss of control in practice because it centers on a mental illness or mental abnormality (as they call it) that makes the defendant less culpable for their actions.

DR is a statutory defence defined in s.2(1) of the Homicide Act 1957. It was amended by s.52 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, but the law is still contained in the Homicide Act.

There are four elements of diminished responsibility:

- 1. That defendant was suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning.
- 2. This arose from a recognised medical condition.
- 3. This substantially impaired their ability to understand the nature of their conduct, form a rational judgment, or exercise self-control.
- 4. The abnormality of mental functioning must provide an explanation for their conduct, which it will if it contributes significantly to the defendant carrying out that conduct.

Firstly, for the defendant to successfully raise this defence, they must prove that they were suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning at the time of killing and that this abnormality arose from a recognised medical condition. When considering the first part, a quote from Byrne (1960) is helpful: "*the question is whether D's state of mind was so different from that of an ordinary person that the reasonable person would term it abnormal.*"

When considering what constitutes recognised medical conditions, we must look to international classifications such as those from the World Health Organisation. There is a broad list of mental health issues that would qualify and the key is that the defendant must be diagnosed with the illness. This covers recognised medical and psychiatric conditions such as depression, personality disorder, and schizophrenia. Importantly, there must be medical assessment and medical evidence of the illness.

Furthermore, it must be shown that this abnormality substantially impaired their ability to understand the nature of their conduct, form a rational judgment, or exercise self-control. This doesn't mean that they didn't know what they were doing but there must be something showing substantial impairment in one of these three areas. "Substantial" here means impairment that is, greater than what would be experienced by a reasonable person: more than trivial but less than total impairment as stated in Simcox (1964). However, in a more recent case of Golds (2014), it was held that judges need not define "substantially" beyond its ordinary meaning; it is up to juries to decide if impairment can properly be described as substantial.

The final aspect of this test is the abnormality must provide an explanation for the defendant's conduct, which it will if it contributes significantly to them carrying out that conduct. In other words, there must be a causal link between the abnormality and their actions.

It's very important to consider all these elements when assessing problem questions in this field. Often problem questions will allude to defendants suffering from depression or other mental illnesses, and students may quickly conclude they can rely on DR. However, this is only a starting point; remember that all the four elements need to be considered independently before DR can be established.

We are now coming to the end of our substantive discussion on murder and partial defences. In conclusion, it's important to know definitions and key cases related to murder and partial defences. It is also important to remember that partial defences have been created to mitigate the effects of mandatory life sentences.

We are now moving on to the final part of this LecturePlus session. You can take a break here or continue. In this final part, I want to briefly talk about problem questions and introduce a past exam question on this topic.

You would have come across many problem questions and hypothetical scenarios in your study of criminal law and other areas of law by now. Problem questions are popular for both teaching and assessing criminal law. They are popular because they mimic legal practice and how you would interact with clients and advise them.

Problem questions test your knowledge and application of current law rather than how it ought to be or how it was in the past. This way of thinking is more for essays.

Another unique feature of problem questions is that a problem question often bring together multiple areas of law. For example, you might have a problem question on homicide that askes you to apply laws on murder along with voluntary and involuntary manslaughter and maybe on causation too. The best answers are clear with consistent analysis applying current law accurately.

When evidencing your answer, try to include as much case law as possible to back up your analysis. Explicitly discuss relevant statutes and sections before using case law for further support.

Importantly, perhaps most importantly, find a way of answering problem questions that makes sense to youâ€”there's no right or wrong way as long as you identify relevant laws then apply them in great detail and you support your analysis.

The IRAC method of solving problem questions stands for Issue; Rule; Application; and Conclusion. While some people find the IRAC method restrictive or technical, it is a very efficient way to tackle problem questions. In criminal law problem questions, you are likely to come across more than one criminal event in a scenario. You should follow the IRAC method to unpack each of those events separately.

When answering problem questions, always read the scenario in full first. Sometimes the final line will give you additional information that you need before you should start tackling it. That final line will also determine the focus of your answer, i.e., whether it will be "Advise A" or simply "Discuss."

After reading the scenario once and ensuring you understand it, try to read it once more, to pick out all the issues. Highlight all issues and then consider which of these issues constitute criminal events or potential offences that you should analyse separately. Once you have identified the key potential offences to consider, follow the IRAC method to unpack each issue. Follow IRAC for each issue separately; once you have identified the issue, defined the rule, applied it, and concluded on it, only then move to consider the next issue. Then you can repeat this process in a continuous loop until you have considered all the potential issues in that scenario.

The first step is to identify the legal issue in the problem. For example: "Did Person A commit murder, or could they raise the partial defence of loss of control?"

Next, identify and state the relevant legal rule. Here you should consider what laws or legal principles apply to this particular issue and use statutes and case law to explain the rule. State the rule accurately and briefly, citing key authority where relevant (e.g., act or it could be a case if it's a common law offence).

After setting out the rule, move on to the application. This is the most critical step where you apply the legal rule to the facts of the case. Analyse how the rule interacts with the specific facts provided. Address counterarguments and differing interpretations, and discuss whether each element of the rule is met or not.

In terms of structure, the majority of your writing should be on the application partâ€”this is where you show your legal knowledge and collect most marks. For criminal law, deal with the actus reus and mens rea of the offence separately. It is traditional to discuss the actus reus first. Once you have established that the defendant has the actus reus required for the offence, then you can move on to discuss mens rea. If you find that the defendant has not fulfilled the actus reus requirement, then usually it is not necessary to consider mens rea.

Always back your analysis up with case law. The importance of knowing case law cannot be overemphasised, particularly in criminal law. If you argue that the defendant fulfilled the mens rea requirement but do not mention the relevant leading case, such as R v Woollin or R v G, you will not get very high marks.

Once you have completed the application and considered the relevant mens rea and actus reus in detail and in reference to case law, then you can conclude. For the conclusion, usually only a sentence suffices, such as "the defendant is likely to be liable" or "not liable for the particular offence."

So to summarise above discussion on the IRAC, I want to highlight the following four points:

- Always refer to relevant case law and legislation.
- Make sure your application is fact-specificâ€”don't just restate the rule.
- Stay concise but thorough in each section.
- Your conclusion should be supported by your analysis.

Do not introduce something different in the conclusion from what you have said in the analysis.

I have given here on screen past exam question that formed part the exams in May 2024. I will read out this question first and then I was say a few particular points about it.

The question reads:

Annie is married to Bert. Their relationship is volatile and Bert can be aggressive, and even violent, when he has been drinking alcohol. One evening, when Annie and Bert are out to dinner with Bert's colleagues, Bert is drinking heavily. Bert begins mocking Annie in front of his colleagues and keeps calling her a 'useless little wifey'. Later that evening, he makes advances to a female colleague in front of Annie and Annie storms out of the restaurant and goes for a walk. Annie returns home later that night to find Bert waiting for her. Bert

immediately calls her a 'loser' for leaving the restaurant. When Annie tries to raise the issue of Bert's advances towards his female colleague in the restaurant, Bert bursts out laughing and says, 'there's plenty of women you don't even know about'. Outraged, Annie grabs a bottle of wine and throws it directly at Bert. Bert moves quickly to avoid being hit by the wine bottle and falls down, before hitting his head on the corner of a table. Bert is unconscious and bleeding. Annie stands over him, and shouts, 'Finally you suffer too! You got what you deserve!' and leaves the house. The neighbours hear the commotion and call for an ambulance. The ambulance takes hours to arrive, and Bert dies of the injuries he sustained in the fall. Discuss Annie's liability for the death of Bert.

This is a classic exam problem question and it is inviting to discuss homicide offences and defences, and this is offering an open-ended opportunity to analyse several key aspects. The starting point should be to identify and consider the actus reus and mens rea of murder, applying the relevant rules of causation and intention. To make sure you can find that murder.

From there, it's essential to evaluate whether a partial defence may be available. For example, if the facts suggest a history of shouting or tension, this might imply a possible loss of control. In this context, you would need to apply the three-part test under sections 54 and 55 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 in great detail. You should consider whether the defendant lost control, whether there was a qualifying trigger, and whether a reasonable person of the same age and sex, sharing the defendant's characteristics, might have acted in the same way.

The response should begin with identifying and discussing each element of the offence of murder before moving systematically exploring potential partial defences. Each element should be analysed step-by-step, applying the relevant legal principles separately to determine whether it could succeed. This should be support by evidence and cases. This structured approach ensures that all aspects of the question are addressed logically and thoroughly.

This question will be posted on the Forum after LecturePlus, you can share your thoughts on the question on the Forum. You can also post your answers to full or partial defences on the Forum and have discussions with your peers.

This final part of the lecture has focused on addressing classic problem questions. In your study of criminal law and during exams, these are the types of questions you are most likely to encounter. However, I want to remind you that the exams include a variety of question formats. These typically consist of essays, problem questions, and multi-part problem questions.

In recent years, the criminal law exam has featured a compulsory question in the form of a multipart problem question. While these resemble traditional problem questions in appearance, they differ in structure. Instead of relying solely on the IRAC method or other methods for answering problem questions, there questions guide you with specific prompts, often asking you to identify and apply key issues step by step.

Since these are compulsory questions, it's essential to practise them well in advance of the revision period. To support your preparation, you'll find a video walkthrough in Topic 9, which focuses on offences against the person. Specifically, this is covered in Mini Lecture 3. If this format feels unfamiliar to you, I highly recommend reviewing that video to ensure you are confident in tackling these types of questions too.

We have reached the end of the lecture on murder and partial defences. During this session, we explored key concepts, and I very encourage you to continue reading on this topic on Laws VLE and from our textbook series. After the lecture, we will post a series of questions on the discussion Forum. You'll find both generic discussion topics and more focused questions there. Please do participate in the discussions. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the Forum.

Thank you for listening.

## 7.4 Involuntary manslaughter

Involuntary manslaughter can be one of three types:

- 'foresight' or 'reckless' manslaughter
- 'unlawful act' or 'constructive' manslaughter
- gross negligence manslaughter (causing death through lack of care).

One of your key tasks is to be clear about their respective areas of coverage. The three forms overlap to a certain extent, but also have their own specific application.

### 7.4.1 Overlap between forms of involuntary manslaughter

Hyam (Hyam [1975] AC 55) and Smith (Smith [1961] AC 290) both killed in the course of doing something extremely dangerous. In the former case, Hyam threw a petrol bomb through V's letter box, while, in the latter case, Smith drove his car extremely dangerously in an attempt to dislodge a police officer trying to arrest him. Both victims were killed. The House of Lords found both defendants had been properly convicted of murder. If these cases came to court today, the outcome would be different. Murder requires an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. And what Hyam and Smith did, although wicked and dangerous, was not done in furtherance of an intention to kill or cause serious injury. They could, however, be charged with:

- reckless manslaughter, if the prosecution could prove foresight of death or serious injury
- gross negligence manslaughter, if, irrespective of whether the prosecution could prove foresight of death or serious injury, the jury considered their actions to be grossly negligent as to the risk of death
- constructive manslaughter, since both defendants killed in the course of doing something illegal and dangerous.

The prosecution will tend to charge the form which is most easy to establish as a matter of evidence. Here, this is probably constructive manslaughter, but the prosecution would still find it relatively easy to gain a conviction charging either of the other two forms.

### 7.4.2 Distinctiveness

There are, however, killings where only one form should be charged. This distinctiveness should be understood. Reckless manslaughter is rarely charged. Since acting with foresight of death or serious injury will usually be a criminal offence, almost all cases of reckless manslaughter will also be cases of constructive (unlawful act)

manslaughter. Since this explanation tells us all we need to know about reckless manslaughter, no more will be said about it in this topic.

Constructive manslaughter is the correct charge when there is evidence that death resulted from an unlawful and objectively dangerous act of D, but there is insufficient evidence that D intended (or foresaw) death or serious injury or was grossly negligent as to the risk of death.

#### **Illustration 7**

A hits B with a single punch to the jaw. B dies as a result of a hidden weakness in his skull which implodes under the force.

This is constructive manslaughter; neither of the other two forms apply since A neither foresaw death nor grievous bodily harm, and nor was he grossly negligent as to the risk of death.

Gross negligence manslaughter is the correct charge where there is insufficient evidence that D foresaw death or serious injury resulting from their conduct and there is no unlawful and dangerous act upon which to graft liability. It is most appropriate, therefore, for those who kill in the course of performing a **lawful activity** in a criminally careless fashion, or who omit to do something they should have done. It covers, for example, parents who neglect their children, train drivers who ignore signals, electricians who forget to earth their circuits, builders who break building regulations, surgeons who perform incompetent surgery on their patients, bus drivers who fall asleep at the wheel and so on.

### 7.4.3 Constructive manslaughter

Constructive manslaughter is also known as unlawful act manslaughter. It is called constructive manslaughter because liability does not derive, as it usually must, from a combination of an *actus reus* and *mens rea* which match a consequence with an equivalent mental state. Rather, liability for one crime is constructed out of the elements of another. For example, one can be guilty of manslaughter if death results from the commission of an assault, criminal damage, burglary, robbery or even theft. The prosecution's task is to prove:

- the elements of the core offence (e.g. the assault, the criminal damage, etc.)
- the objective likelihood that harm would result from the commission of that offence, and
- a causal connection between the core offence and the death.

This offence is, in the opinion of most commentators, unjust, since â€“ as Illustration 7 shows â€“ the criminal label may seriously overstate the gravity of the defendant's wrongdoing.

Actus reus: constructive manslaughter

#### An act

To be guilty of constructive manslaughter, the cause of death must be an act. This is one of the few crimes which cannot be committed by omission. Omissions are not sufficient even where there is a duty of care. So, in Lowe [1973] QB 702, D was charged with the constructive manslaughter of his child, whom he had badly neglected. He was convicted on the basis that he had caused his child's death through the commission of a criminal offence. That offence is wilful neglect of a child (s.1 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933). D's conviction was quashed. The Court of Appeal ruled that an act was of the essence for constructive manslaughter. This charge would have been proper if the child had died as a result of injuries sustained through a beating. As no such acts could be established, the case should have been charged as one of gross negligence manslaughter. No doubt the prosecution chose to charge constructive manslaughter because it was easier to establish the commission of the s.1 offence than it was to establish gross negligence on D's part. The Court of Appeal saw through this cunning plan!

#### An act which is criminally unlawful

This is an important point. It was first established in Franklin (1883) 15 Cox CC 163, in which D killed a swimmer when he threw a wooden crate off a pier into the sea. D's conviction for constructive manslaughter was quashed, since what he had done, although wrongful, was not a criminal wrong. In deciding whether someone has committed constructive manslaughter, therefore, the first guestion to ask is whether the death resulted from the commission of a crime. This crime must, moreover, be identified by the prosecution in the particulars of offence (Jennings [1990] Crim LR 588).

Larkin [1943] KB 174 and Lamb [1967] 2 QB 981 are authorities for the proposition that the prosecution must be able to prove all the elements of a criminal offence to support a conviction for constructive manslaughter. But the prosecution's task does not stop there. If D has a defence to the core offence â€“ for example, consent or selfdefence â€“ again, no conviction for unlawful act manslaughter will arise. In Scarlett [1993] 4 All ER 629, D, a publican, ejected a drunk from a public house, who then fell backwards down the steps and died following a fractured skull. D's conviction for constructive manslaughter was quashed on the basis that he feared the drunk was about to attack him and so his use of force was lawful self-defence. This meant that he had not committed the core offence that constructive manslaughter requires.

Recently, the Court of Appeal clarified the elements of constructive manslaughter in R v Grey [2024] EWCA Crim 487. The appellant, Grey, who had cerebral palsy, impaired vision and cognitive impairment, was convicted of manslaughter after confronting a cyclist on a pavement, swinging her arm towards the cyclist and shouting

profanities. This caused the cyclist to fall into the road, where she was fatally struck by a car. The Court of Appeal quashed Grey's conviction, finding that the base offence of assault or battery had not been clearly identified or established during the trial. Without the base offence, there was no proper basis for Grey's conviction for manslaughter.

#### Constructive manslaughter and crimes of negligence: a qualification

Certain activities are lawful if done properly, but unlawful if done dangerously or negligently. The most common example of these are driving offences. If D commits a driving offence, such as speeding or dangerous driving, which results in V being killed, is D automatically guilty of constructive manslaughter? This is an important question because, if the answer is yes, it would threaten to put a lot of people, whose only fault is negligence or absent-mindedness, behind bars, It would also absorb the space currently occupied by gross negligence manslaughter and render a conviction for negligent killing easier â€“ indeed, far too easy. In Andrews [1937] AC 576, the House of Lords ruled that only acts which are inherently criminal can form the basis of a constructive manslaughter charge. Lord Atkin said in this case: 'There is an obvious difference in the law of manslaughter between doing an unlawful act and doing a lawful act with a degree of carelessness which the legislature makes criminal'. In other words, you cannot charge constructive manslaughter if the only criminal wrong committed by the defendant is speeding, driving while intoxicated, dangerous driving or driving without due care. In such cases, the prosecution must charge gross negligence manslaughter, which will necessitate the prosecution proving not merely the carelessness or dangerousness required by the core crime but also gross negligence as to death.

#### **Study task 6**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 13.7.B.1 'The elements of constructive manslaughter', Section 'Dangerous act' and 13.7.C 'Manslaughter by breach of duty' and answer the following questions.

- a. Why was Slingsby not quilty of constructive manslaughter?
- b. Lamb shot dead his friend. Why was he not quilty of constructive manslaughter?

Show feedback

- a. The admittedly rough acts perpetrated on his partner were consented to and hence were not unlawful. Liability for constructive manslaughter requires the acts performed to be criminally unlawful.
- b. To have been guilty would have required the prosecution to establish that the act which caused death was a crime. Strangely, you might think, it is not a crime to shoot someone, even if one does so

negligently. If Lamb had intended to put his friend in fear or foresaw that this might be his reaction then there would have been a crime onto which liability for manslaughter could be grafted but here there was no fear and no intention or foresight as the boys were only playing.

#### The criminal act must be dangerous

'Dangerous' is a term of art here. It does not mean threatening to life or limb; it means simply of a nature to cause harm. A punch, then, is dangerous because punches often result in harm, albeit not serious harm. A punch was the core activity which resulted in a manslaughter conviction in the leading case of Church [1966] 1 QB 59. In this case, Edmund Davies LJ gave the following authoritative definition of what counts as a dangerous act:

the act must be such that all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognise must subject the other person to, at least, the risk of some harm resulting therefrom, albeit not serious harm.

#### **Study task 7**

Try to apply the principle in the Church case to the following problem.

Jack lets the tyres down on Jill's car. Jill does not notice this when she returns to the car and drives off. She soon notices the problem, panics and brakes suddenly. Humpty, who is driving too closely to stop in time, crashes into the back of Jill's car, killing her. Is Jack guilty of constructive manslaughter? To answer this question, your job is to analyse the facts to ensure that all the elements of the offence are present, including in particular the dangerousness requirement as defined by Edmund Davies LJ in Church.

The phrase 'the other person' in the Church quotation does not mean that the dangerous act need be directed against the deceased specifically. It could be directed against a third party, as happened in Mitchell [1983] 2 All ER 427 (the altercation in the Post Office queue case; see Topic 4), but it must be of a nature to cause harm to someone. So, in the scenario presented in Study Task 7, it would make no difference to Jack's potential liability if the deceased was Jill, Jill's baby who was in the front baby seat, or Humpty.

Two cases involving different outcomes from similar actions illustrate this meaning of 'dangerous acts'. In Dawson (1985) 81 Cr App R 150, D pointed a replica gun at V in the course of a robbery. V had a history of heart conditions and died of a heart attack; D was convicted of constructive manslaughter. On appeal, his conviction was quashed because the judge had not made clear to the jury that it could convict only if **pointing the gun** was objectively dangerous. And it would be objectively dangerous only if it was known that V had a heart condition â€“ this had not been established.

In Watson [1989] 1 WLR 684, D committed burglary on a house occupied by V, an 87-year-old man who suffered from a heart condition. The encounter between D and V resulted in V being disturbed and upset, and a little later he suffered a heart attack and died. D was convicted of manslaughter. Although his appeal was successful on other grounds, the Court of Appeal made clear, on the basis of the Church definition, that D's encounter with V was objectively dangerous, as soon as it became clear that V was old and frail. Continuing with the burglary after this realisation would therefore satisfy the dangerous act requirement.

#### **Study task 8**

Would it make any difference, in the case of Dawson, if D had pointed: (a) a real gun that was not loaded; or (b) a real gun that was loaded? To answer this question you must apply the dicta in Church.

#### The dangerous act must cause death

Establishing causation is not generally a problem for the prosecution, as was seen in Topic 4. It will normally follow from the fact that but for D's act the death would not have occurred, although this is not always the case. D's act must be the substantial and operating cause, which it will not be if, independently of D's action, another cause intervenes which rids D's initial act of all causal potency. (For a good example, see the discussion of Rafferty in Wilson, Section 5.6.A.4 'Breaking the chain of causation â€“ intervening cause supersedes defendant's act' and see for comparison R v Grant [2021] EWCA Crim 1243 discussed in Topic 4.) A particular causal sequence in which this routinely happens involves the supply of dangerous drugs. Supplying drugs is a criminal act and it is dangerous in the Church sense. However, if V self-injects and this causes V's death, D (who supplied the drugs) is not quilty of manslaughter. V's free and informed act breaks the chain of causation (Kennedy (No 2) [2007] UKHL 38). Two cases show the limits of Kennedy. It is not simply the fact that V self-administers the intoxicant that renders the chain of causation broken. It is the fact that the decision to self-administer is voluntary, i.e. is free and informed. The jury have the power to conclude, as where the victim is a drug addict or has been deceived into taking the intoxicant, that it is not voluntary. See the discussion of Field and Rebelo in Topic 4.

If, however, D does the injecting then D will be liable for constructive manslaughter if this results in V's death. Here, however, it is not the act of supply which will form the basis of the charge, but the administration of the drug (an offence under s.23 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861). D will remain liable because no subsequent act or event intervenes, following this administration, to break the chain of causation (Cato [1976] 1 WLR 110).

Another knotty problem concerns acts of the defendant towards V, which triggers V's suicide. What test of causation is to be applied here? Is it 'take your victim as you find them?', as in Blaue; a reasonable foresight test, as in Roberts; a daft or disproportionate reaction test, as in Williams; or a voluntary act test, as in Kennedy? In Wallace (see Section 4.3.6), the Court of Appeal sidestepped this question, ruling that the question to be considered in all cases where more than one cause contributed to the death is whether 'the accused's acts can fairly be said to have made a significant contribution to the victim's death'.

#### Mens rea

As has been explained, constructive liability involves the defendant being held liable for crime A on the basis of their liability for committing crime B. If, therefore, D is being charged with constructive manslaughter (crime A) on the basis of having committed an assault (crime B), all the prosecution has to establish is that V's death was caused as a result of the assault (crime B). Setting aside proof of causation, which is a given, its first task is to prove the actus reus of assault (e.g. a punch). Its second task is to prove the mens rea for assault, that is intending or foreseeing (recklessness) unlawful physical contact with V.

##### **Study task 9**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 13.7.B.1 (b) 'Dangerous act' and answer the following question.

Read the discussion of DPP v Newbury and Jones (1977). Is it necessary for the prosecution to prove that the defendants foresaw harm resulting from their criminal action?

#### Reform proposals

The Law Commission recommended abolishing the rule in Newbury and Jones, which permits liability in the absence of foresight of harm. Under its proposals, manslaughter will encompass 'killing through a criminal act intended to cause some injury, or in the awareness that the act posed a serious risk of causing some injury'. These proposals were considered by the Court of Appeal in  $R \vee F$ .

##### **Study task 10**

- a. In DPP v Newbury and Jones what exactly was the crime that formed the substance of the charge and subsequent conviction for constructive manslaughter?
- b. What was the important point of law proposed by the Court of Appeal in Jennings (1990)?
- c. Under what circumstances, if any, can a person be guilty of constructive manslaughter for having caused V to commit suicide?

### 7.4.4 Gross negligence manslaughter (manslaughter by breach of duty)

People whose gross carelessness results in death may be charged with gross negligence manslaughter, the essence of which is a breach of a legal duty to be careful. Such duties do not exist in a vacuum. As we have seen in Topic 3, for example, where death is caused by an omission, such a duty exists only where it has been voluntarily assumed, or where there is a contract, special relationship and so on. So a lifeguard may be quilty of gross negligence manslaughter for failing to save a child drowning in their swimming pool, but not an expert swimmer who is in attendance and witnesses the whole affair.

Whether a duty exists in cases of affirmative action causing death is a matter of law to be decided by the trial judge. In the civil law of negligence, such duties tend to arise by virtue of the duty holder being in a position where their actions are likely to cause harm to another if care is not taken. The criminal law follows this pattern to a large extent, but the fact that a duty is not recognised in the civil law does not mean that it will not be recognised in the criminal setting. In Wacker [2002] EWCA Crim 1944, a lorry driver transported illegal immigrants in an airless container, which led to the deaths of most of them. He was held properly convicted of manslaughter for his failure in this regard. Although in the civil law such a duty would probably not have arisen due to the immigrants' complicity in an illegal enterprise, no such stricture applied in the criminal law, where deeper considerations of public policy applied. A similar result was seen in Willoughby [2004] EWCA Crim 3365, where D and V torched D's building for the purpose of committing an insurance fraud, during which V died. Again, although no duty of care would have arisen in civil law, a duty did arise in criminal law and D was quilty of manslaughter.

The modern law of gross negligence manslaughter derives from the leading case of Adomako [1995] 1 AC 171, in which an anaesthetist was charged with manslaughter for failing to supervise properly a patient who was given a general anaesthetic in the course of an eye operation: the patient died when, unnoticed by the defendant, his oxygen supply was cut off. The House of Lords made a number of important statements of principle in the course of this case. In particular, it deprecated the trial judge's use of the term recklessness to describe the fault element and said that trial judges should direct the jury in terms of gross negligence only in cases where a lack of care is alleged to be the cause of death.

The elements of gross negligence manslaughter, as stemmed from Adomako and subsequently expanded are as follows:

- 1. The defendant owed the victim a duty of care.
- 2. The defendant breached the duty.
- 3. There was a serious and obvious risk of death.

- 4. It was reasonably foreseeable at the time of the breach of the duty that the breach gave rise to a serious and obvious risk of death.
- 5. The breach of duty caused death.
- 6. The breach of duty was gross.

#### Duty of care

As explained above, it is a matter of law for the judge to decide whether the defendant owed a duty of care to the victim. The jury's function is to decide whether the duty was breached and if the death was caused by the breach. This principle was affirmed in Evans [2009] EWCA Crim 650, in which the Court of Appeal introduced a new duty situation in cases of manslaughter by omission â€“ namely, one arising where the defendant is responsible for contributing to circumstances of extreme danger for the victim. This was an extension of the principle in Miller, in which the House of Lords had limited this duty to cases where the dangerous situation was caused by the defendant (see Topic 3). Now it is enough that they simply contributed to the danger. In the words of Lord Judge CJ:

When a person has created or contributed to the creation of a state of affairs which he knows, or ought reasonably to know, has become life threatening, a consequent duty on him to act by taking reasonable steps to save the other's life will normally arise.

### Breach of duty

How negligent does a person have to be to breach their duty of care? Very! In Adomako, the standard of care was described as follows.

[Responsibility] will depend on the seriousness of the breach of duty committed by the defendant in all the circumstances in which the defendant was placed when it occurred... [The jury must consider] whether, having regard to the risk of death involved, the conduct of the defendant was so bad in all the circumstances as to amount in their judgment to a criminal act or omission.

(Adomako [1995] 1 AC 171 per Lord Mackay)

The threshold of risk has, however, increased over the past few decades. Note here that liability for gross negligence manslaughter requires there to be a risk of death. There is no liability if the risk is simply of harm/serious harm (compare constructive manslaughter).

In Singh (1999) Crim LR 582 the Court of Appeal approved the judge's summing up in which he stated that the requirement was negligence as to the risk of death, 'not merely of injury or even of serious injury'. This principle was confirmed in Misra [2004] EWCA Crim 2375 and clearly further articulated in Rose [2017] EWCA Crim 1168. In Rose, an optometrist failed to conduct a full examination of the deceased's eyes during a sight test. If the optometrist had done so, she would have discovered that the deceased had a life-threatening condition and would have sent her for urgent specialist attention. Her conviction for gross negligence manslaughter was guashed. The Court of Appeal agreed that her failure to conduct a full examination was very negligent. However, the fact that a proper examination might have revealed a serious life-threatening problem did not mean that there was a 'serious and obvious risk of death' if such an examination was not carried out. This was, after all, a simple routine eye test. It might have been different if the patient had presented with symptoms that themselves had either pointed to the risk of a potentially life-threatening condition or provided a sign that alerted a competent optometrist to that risk.

When breaching the duty of care, it is now clear that defendants conduct must pose a risk of death to victim that is both serious and obvious, as well as being reasonably foreseeable. In Kuddus [2019] EWCA Crim 837 an owner and a chef of a curry house was initially convicted for manslaughter after preparing a meal containing peanut proteins for the deceased, a girl who identified this allergy on the takeaway order. The Court of Appeal, quashing the conviction, said that the defendant did not know about circumstances that made the risk of death serious and obvious â€“ even though they should have known. Importantly, the court made a distinction between the elements of a serious and obvious risk of death and foresight of that risk.

Finally, a note on causation. After it has been established that the defendant breached a duty of care owed to the victim, and that breach involved a serious and obvious risk of death, which was reasonable foreseeable, the prosecution must show that the defendant's breach caused the death. Standard rules of causation discussed in Topic 4 are thought to apply even if Broughton [2020] EWCA Crim 1093 introduces some confusion.

It has been argued that the offence of gross negligence manslaughter breaches Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which proscribes retrospective criminalisation. This is because the line between mere negligence and gross negligence is not precisely drawn. Whether a person's conduct amounts to gross negligence, therefore, cannot be assessed in advance but only by a jury deciding ex post facto. This argument was rejected in Amit Misra [2004] EWCA Crim 2375.

## Lecture plus 2 - Involuntary Manslaughter


Welcome to this Criminal Law spring Lecture Plus on involuntary manslaughter. My name is Dr Laura Lammasniemi.

In this lecture, we will discuss,

- Difference between murder and manslaughter
- Unlawful act manslaughter and how it operates and where its difficulties lay
- Gross negligence manslaughter and how it operates

Here we have a diagram of English law on homicide. You can see that while we have a number of subheadings, we only have two offences: murder and manslaughter. To hear more about murder, please listen to the Autumn 2021 Lecture Plus on Murder. This session solely focuses on the left hand side of the diagram and on involuntary manslaughter. The key difference between these two serious offences is that murder requires intent to kill or to cause Grievous Bodily Harm (GBH) where as involuntary manslaughter covers all scenarios where there has been an unlawful killing but that unlawful killing was not intentional.

All homicide offences share some common elements. These are that the killing must be unlawful and that the victim must be a human being. These are core elements for both murder and manslaughter. You might think this is obvious but far more it, and the courts have grappled with things like when does life begin and end a fair bit over the centuries and past few decades.

Firstly, killing must be unlawful. Death that is purely accidental is lawful and therefore not blameworthy. Second important aspect to remember is that one cannot consent to death. Euthanasia or mercy killing is not a defence under English criminal law, and someone who performs mercy killing or euthanasia would be liable for murder under the law as it is. This principle has been long established but was recently confirmed in the cases brought by Tony Nicklinson.

Before we move on to discuss two of the main forms of manslaughter, constructive and gross negligence manslaughters, I want to quickly recap all possible routes to find manslaughter convictions.

While murder is kept within strict boundaries through the requirement that the unlawful killing was intentional, the offence of involuntary manslaughter captures instances of unintentional killing. As such, it is easy to see how this offence involves a huge scope of potential liability, which stretches from nearly intentional killing, to instances of killing that can almost be considered accidental.

One important point that we must bear in mind is that, although involuntary manslaughter comprises one offence, it is an offence that can be committed in three different ways. Two forms of manslaughter, constructive manslaughter and gross negligence manslaughter, are firmly

established and often used in criminal law; the third form, reckless manslaughter, is far more infrequently identified.

Constructive, or unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter, is when someone commits an unlawful and dangerous act with the necessary mens rea, and that act causes death. This is an extremely broad form of liability for a very serious criminal offence, something which has created no small amount of problems.

Gross negligence manslaughter is when someone breaches a duty of care owed to another person, causing the other person's death, and that breach of duty is considered gross. There are a few issues with this. One particular issue regarding this form of manslaughter is that, partially because it is grounded on an objective category of fault, it can be committed by omission, and without any appreciation or subjective foresight on the part of the defendant. A second concerns the translation of a civil law concept, namely duty of care, into a criminal one. A third concerns what is meant by "gross" in gross negligence.

Finally we have reckless manslaughter. Reckless manslaughter is when someone causes death in a situation where they subjectively foresaw that their actions might cause serious injury to someone else. Although much narrower in scope than the other two forms, reckless manslaughter may perhaps be the form of manslaughter that most accurately reflects the level of blameworthiness that would be expected of such a serious offence. In practice it appears mainly to be subsumed within the other two forms of manslaughter. Reckless manslaughter is rarely used these days. As it is rarely used this lecture only focuses on constructive and gross negligence manslaughter.

The last thing I want to say about the basic nature of manslaughter before we consider individual offences is that it is a very broad offence. It covers situations that are quite close to murder but just fall short of it to deaths that are near accidental.

Manslaughter includes a whole range of circumstances including the so-called one punch killer. This term is coined to cover situations where the defendant took one punch or hit the victim once, and then as a consequence, the victim dies possibly after hitting their head while falling down. With manslaughter it is good to remember that effectively what the law criminalises is the consequences over the defendant's actions. If the victim in the case of one punch killer had not fallen, or died, the defendant would be liable for battery or possibly causing grievous bodily harm â€“ both of which are nowhere near as serious as offences as manslaughter is.

To reflect this broadness, sentencing for manslaughter is entirely discretional. This means that depending on the circumstances of the killing, and mitigating and aggravating factors, a sentence for manslaughter can be non-custodial or life imprisonment. Most defendants found guilty of manslaughter receive 2-10 year custodial sentences.

Next we move on to discuss constructive manslaughter. This is also often spoken of as the unlawful act manslaughter but they mean the same offence.

Unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter is also called 'constructive manslaughter' as it is constructed on the basis of an unlawful act.

There are three elements required before liability for unlawful act manslaughter can be found. These are that firstly, there must be a basic crime on which the manslaughter charge builds on(this is the 'unlawful' part). Secondly, the basic crime must cause death. Finally, the basic act must be 'dangerous'.

A typical example of an unlawful act would be the one punch killer. Imagine a person who takes a swing at another person; the person falls on the grounds breaking their skull, and subsequently dies. There is no question of intent to kill therefore the person could not be held

liable for murder but they would be for manslaughter. They have committed an unlawful act of battery by punching another person, and following the rules of causation, they would have been deemed to cause the death. Hitting another person can lead to harm so it is objectively dangerous, therefore all the elements would be met.

Let's pack these elements a bit further now. Firstly, the unlawful act. The unlawful act must be a crime. A civil wrong or tort, or let alone a moral wrong would not suffice here. The prosecution needs to be able to identify the offence firstly, and then construct liability for manslaughter on the basis of that offence. If they cannot find liability for the base offence, there cannot be liability for manslaughter either. Often the base offence would be a crime of violence but it doesn't need to be, any offence would suffice here. Following the case of *Lowe*, we know that the unlawful act needs to be an actual act and omission would not suffice. Finally, it is essential that the offence is established in full.

In the case of *Lamb*, there were two boys who were playing with a revolver. While there were bullets in the chamber, the boys believed it wasn't capable of firing. One of the boys pointed the gun at the other and fired. As he pulled the trigger the gun went off killing the boy. The boy who fired the gun was first charged with unlawful act manslaughter but the court held there was no unlawful act, because there was no apprehension that the gun would fire and therefore no base offence.

It is important to remember that there is NO additional mens rea element for unlawful act manslaughter, just the mens rea for the unlawful offence needs to be established. So if the unlawful offence is complete, the defendant would fulfil mens rea requirements for unlawful act manslaughter too. There is no additional mens rea for the death that followed.

The first element is that there is an unlawful act that the defendant has committed. The second is that there must be a causal link between the death and the unlawful act. Here normal rules of causation apply, meaning you need to be able to establish factual causation, legal causation and to be able to consider if anything might have broken the chain of causation. If you are not sure of rules of causation, please go back to the study guide and module materials on the topic. Causation is an important part of all result crimes and therefore you must know it. I want to highlight a few complex issues around causation and constructive manslaughter. These are so called drug cases and cases where the courts have considered whether a person can be held liable for the suicide of another.

Often causation is straightforward. The defendant hits the victim, they might shoot or stab them, and so causation isn't that much of an issue. Yet, in recent years, there are two areas that have risen as particularly complex areas of causation in cases of unlawful act manslaughter. These are drug supply cases and cases of liability for the suicide of another person.

Cases dealing with drug deaths are often the most complex, and arguably illogical areas of causation rules.

In *Dias* it was held that supplying drugs alone is not enough to create liability if the victim later overdoses and dies. The courts have stuck to this principle but there have been cases that have been muddying the waters.

The most important case on the issue of supplying and preparing drugs for consumption is the case of *Kennedy (No 2)*. Kennedy was initially convicted for manslaughter following the death of the victim. Kennedy had prepared the syringe with class-A drugs, handed it over to the victim who then self-injected and died. He appealed his conviction, and the appeal reached all the way to the House of Lords due to the importance of the issue.

The House of Lords decided, quashing Kennedy's conviction that self-administering drugs break the chain of causation. In other words, the person who sells the drugs is not the cause of death as choosing to inject or take drugs is an independent act.

In this case the House of Lords concluded:

It is possible to imagine factual scenarios in which two people could properly be regarded as acting together to administer an injection. But nothing of the kind was the case here. As in *R v Dalby* and *R v Dias* the appellant supplied the drug to the deceased, who then had a choice, knowing the facts, whether to inject himself or not. The heroin was, as the certified question correctly recognises, self-administered, not jointly administered. The appellant did not administer the drug. Nor, for reasons already given, did the appellant cause the drug to be administered to or taken by the deceased.

The answer to the certified question is: "In the case of a fully-informed and responsible adult, never".

In other words the chain of causation is broken. This decision brings clarity to the legal system, and to the drug cases. It also can be argued fair as drug dealers should be no more liable for their clients' overdoses than bar owners ought to be if their clients die due to excessive drinking.

The decision in *Kennedy* is somewhat at odds with cases where the defendant has prepared and administered the drug to the victim who has subsequently died. In the case of *Cato*, the defendant had bought drugs that were consumed by others who lived with him. The residents, all habitual heroin users, paired off to inject the drugs. In the morning, the victim who Cato had injected, was dead. Cato was convicted of manslaughter.

Even if the victim had requested Cato to inject him, and had participated in injecting others this did not matter nor break the chain of causation. There was no break between the actions of the defendant and the outcome, therefore, Cato was held liable. Similarly in the 2003 case of *Rogers*, the defendant was held liable for unlawful act manslaughter despite the fact that the victim selfinjected as he helped to administer the drug by applying a tourniquet. It was considered that the defendant had played a part in mechanics of injection.

So it is clear that there are questions that remain unanswered after *Kennedy*. For one, whether drawing the line between selling a drug and preparing a syringe and administering a drug from that syringe is somewhat artificial. Furthermore, in these cases where we are faced with victims whose lives revolve around drug addiction, can we really say that they are 'fully-informed and responsible adults' making clear, voluntary decisions?

The second area where the courts have struggled is when the victim commits a suicide, as a direct consequence of actions of another person.

This is an important area of causation and one that is particularly important in cases where victims are victims of domestic violence. Studies show that the link between suicidality and domestic violence is clear, and studies show that most women who commit suicide have been victims of domestic violence. For young people there is a clear link between bullying and self harm, and suicide. So there are instances where it is clear link and it is clear that systematic and targeted violence and bullying has led another to take their own life, but as it is, there is no liability for causing the suicide of another person.

The most important case in the field is *R v Dhaliwal* [2006]. Gurda Dhaliwal was married to the defendant when she was only 19 years old. Throughout their marriage he was controlling, violent, and emotionally abusive. She called the police a few times, and was hospitalised after a suicide attempt. She quoted as a reason for her attempted suicide as 'trouble at home'. Once she returned home, their domestic life continued as it had been, abusive. One evening, her husband hit her again. Later that evening she committed suicide.

In the first prosecution of this kind, CPS prosecuted Dhaliwal for manslaughter following the suicide of his wife. He was not convicted as the court was not satisfied she was suffering from recognised mental illness that he had caused.

In the case of *Dhaliwal* the court really battled here with some key questions such as could psychological abuse constitute a crime?

The court distinguished between 'psychological' from 'psychiatric' injury. They held that 'psychiatric' injury is sufficient as this can be recognised by psychiatric testimony, and if there is psychiatric testimony to show that such injury existed, there can be liability. The court said that psychiatric injury is a form of serious harm or assault under the OAPA 1861, s.20 following the case of *Ireland v Burstow* (1998). While they were willing to accept 'psychiatric' injury, they did not accept psychological injury would. This is where there is no medical evidence to support the illness.

So the question that cases such as *Dhaliwal* raise is that can another person be liable for the suicide of another person, or is suicide always an autonomous act?

If we consider that suicide is an autonomous act, there can be no liability as suicide becomes a victim intervention. If however we consider that in these cases, the decision to end one's life is not voluntary or free but caused by the actions of the another person, the liability for unlawful act manslaughter arises. This means that those who systematically abuse their partners, could be held liable for manslaughter if as a result of that abuse, their partners commit suicide.

Vanessa Munro has written extensively on the case of *Dhaliwal* and ono domestic abuse. She has said in a piece written with Sangeeta Shah that:

'the abuser does not pull the trigger or provide the rope. The victim may even see the act as a form of liberationâ€¦. But this does not mean that the actions of the abuser are not a significant cause of death, [or] that â€¦ taking one's life [reflects] voluntary agency'.

As it stands, these two areas â€“ drug supply cases and suicide â€“ remain a developing and complex area of unlawful act manslaughter.

The final element of unlawful act manslaughter is that the unlawful act that resulted in death must be objectively dangerous. In the case of *Church*, it was held that there must be an

'act . . . Such that **all sober and reasonable people** would inevitably recognise must subject the other person to, **at least the risk of some harm** resulting therefrom, albeit **not serious harm**'.

It is not a question of the defendant foresaw but rather a question of whether a reasonable person would recognise the risk so this is an objective test to a degree. The test is for whether there was foresight of some harm but not serious harm or death. For example, let's contrast a few cases to dig a little bit deeper into this reasonable person test means. Lets contrast the cases of *Dawson* and *Watson*. In the case of *Dawson* (1985), the defendant committed an armed robbery on a petrol station, during which the attendant who was a 60 year old man died from a heart attack. As the victim was only 60 years old, in this case it was held that it was not reasonably foreseeable that the victim would suffer a heart attack and the defendants appeal was allowed. In comparison, in the case of *Watson*, a frail 87 year old man suffered a heart attack and died during a prolonged burglary. In this case the court held that a reasonable person would have appreciated risk during the course of burglary, and therefore they were convicted of unlawful act manslaughter. These principles were confirmed in the 2009 case of *Carey* where the victim was a 15 year old girl with heart condition. It was held that a reasonable person would not

have seen risk of harm in that case. The key principle to apply comes from the case of *Church* and you must consider would reasonable people have see a risk of some harm albeit not serious harm.

In conclusion to this first part, there are three elements that need to be satisfied to find liability. Firstly there must be a basic crime on which the manslaughter charge builds on ('unlawful'). Secondly the basic crime must cause the death (causation) therefore you need to find a causal link. And finally the basic act must be 'dangerous'. We know form the case of *Church* that dangerousness needs the risk of some harm.

Constructive manslaughter, as we have seen, very much penalises the consequences not the direct actions of the defendant. It converts what would be a lesser crime such as battery, administering drugs, robbery, into a far more serious offence of homicide due to the consequences. Here the law recognises that people need to accept consequences of their 'bad actions' but equally we can question if this is fair for the defendant as the defendant had no intent or desire to kill, and often this is simply a question of bad luck.

Next, we will move on to discuss gross negligence manslaughter (GNM).

The definition of the GNM comes from the case of *Adomako*. Adomako was an anaesthetist in charge of a patient during an eye operation. During the operation an oxygen pipe became disconnected and the patient died. The appellant failed to notice or respond to obvious signs of disconnection. The jury convicted him of gross negligence manslaughter. In this case

Lord Mackay LC set the test for gross negligence manslaughter. I will quote here. This is quite a long quote but it explains in full what the judge said in the case. The quote begins:

"On this basis in my opinion the ordinary principles of the law of negligence apply to ascertain whether or not the defendant has been in breach of a duty of care towards the victim who has died. If such breach of duty is established the next question is whether that breach of duty caused the death of the victim. If so, the jury must go on to consider whether that breach of duty should be characterised as gross negligence and therefore as a crime. This will depend on the seriousness of the breach of duty committed by the defendant in all the circumstances in which the defendant was placed when it occurred. The jury will have to consider whether the extent to which the defendant's conduct departed from the proper standard of care incumbent upon him, involving as it must have done a risk of death to the patient, was such that it should be judged criminal.

The essence of the matter which is supremely a jury question is whether having regard to the risk of death involved, the conduct of the defendant was so bad in all the circumstances as to amount in their judgment to a criminal act or omission..."

## (end of quote)

In other words from this long quote, we get the four elements that we need and under these four elements needed to find liability for GNM following the case of *Adomako.* The prosecution must show:

- 1. Duty of care
- 2. Breach of established duty
- 3. Breach of duty caused death
- 4. It was grossly negligent

You might find some different ways of categorising these crimes and occasionally different ways of discussing these elements but in all those descriptions all of these 4 elements must be ther - Duty of care, Breach of duty, causation and gross negligence.

In the case of *Adomako*, the court made it clear that ordinary principles of negligence apply in cases of GNM. Often GNM are committed by omission; then there is a duty to do something and the defendant failed in that duty. If you are slightly unclear about omission and what it means it would be good to go over the principles of omission liability from the earlier studies of actus reus if you are not entirely clear on what omission liability is.There are certain categories in criminal law where duty of care rises and failure to act is criminalised. These would be things like doctor patient relationship, parent and child, contractual duties that would bind lifeguard for example and so on.

So in *Adomako*, the court was clear that normal rules of negligence and duty of care apply here but it is important to remember that the tort law principles of duty of care are reset in the criminal law context. This was confirmed in the sad case of *Wacker* (2002). In *Wacker*, the appellant was the driver of a lorry carrying 60 Chinese illegal immigrants from Rotterdam to England. The lorry had a concealed compartment in which the people were placed. Once inside they were sealed in. The lorry was a refrigerated lorry which meant that there was no ventilation. There was one air vent. The victims were told that if the vent was shut, they must be silent to avoid detection. The appellant shut the vent 10 minutes before boarding the ferry. He did not reopen it. The lorry was on the ferry for 10 hours. Consequently 58 people inside the car suffocated to death. The appellant was convicted of gross negligence manslaughter for each of the deaths to reflect the severity of his offence. He appealed on the grounds that one of the general principles of the law of negligence, known by the Latin maxim of *ex turpi causa non oritur act*io, was that the law of negligence did not recognise the relationship between those involved in a criminal enterprise as giving rise to a duty of care owed by one participant to another. The court rejected this, and that this principle did not operate in criminal law to negate a duty of care. His conviction for 58 counts of manslaughter was rightly upheld by the courts.

Once duty of care has been established, the second element is that of breach of duty, and this is assessed objectively. Objective test requires us to ask how a reasonable person would have acted in the situation and did defendants conduct fall below how the reasonable person would have acted?

In the 2017 case of *Rose*, the court also prompted the jury to ask if a reasonable person had foreseen a serious and obvious risk of death. Rose was an optometrist who failed to use the correct scans of victims eyes, and victim died from an otherwise treatable condition. In *Rose* it was confirmed that the jury should apply the reasonable person test to what was foreseeable *at the time* that defendant acted or omitted to act.

Like in all homicide offences, it is absolutely paramount to show that there is a causal link between death and defendants actions. Here you need to show a causal link between the death and the defendants breach of duty.

In relation to unlawful act manslaughter, I have said previously that there can be no liability for manslaughter when defendant supplies drugs and vitim dies. In GNM cases, it gets more complicated â€“ again!

Recently, in August of 2020, the Court of Appeal considered whether a rapper, Ceon Broughton, should remain in prison for GNM following the death of his girlfriend. Broughton was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence and supplying a class A drug after his girlfriend had overdosed, and instead of calling help, he had watched and filmed her while she was dying. The appellant court released Broughton, saying the causal link could not be made here. This is

certainly true in the vast majority of drug cases, and we heard earlier than following *Kennedy (No 2)* a person cannot be held liable for unlawful act manslaughter if the person to whom drugs were supplied dies.

The difference here is that the liability isn't based on supplying the drugs or the criminal act but instead the breach of duty, in other words â€“ the failure to act when it became clear that the Victim needed help.

It is very rare to find liability for GNM in drug cases (as Broughton shows) but one exception to this is the case of *Evans* which we will discuss next.

Gemma Evans was convicted of gross negligence manslaughter along with her mother in relation to the death of her 17 year old half sister, Carly Townsend. You can see Gemma and her mother on the screen. Carly Townsend who died of a heroin overdose was 17 years old. The appellant, her mother and Carly all had a history of heroin addiction. In fact Gemma and Carly's step father died of a heroin overdose earlier on. In that fatal evening it was alleged but never proven that the defendant Gemma Evans bought some heroin and gave it to Carly. Carly self injected the heroin and then developed symptoms which the appellant, from her own experience, recognised as being consistent with a drug overdose. The appellant and her mother decided not to seek medical assistance for fear of getting into trouble or getting Carly into trouble. Carly died. Gemma Evens was convicted of GNM manslaughter and later appealed against her conviction. She argued that the judge had left it to the jury to decide whether the appellant owed a duty of care and that it was wrong to leave this to the jury where this would involve an extension of principles relating to duty of care.

Her appeal was dismissed, and the judges upheld her conviction. The Judge said that

"The duty necessary to find gross negligence manslaughter is plainly not confined to cases of a familial or professional relationship between the defendant and the deceased. In our judgment, consistently with Adomako and the link between civil and criminal liability for negligence, for the purposes of gross negligence manslaughter, when a person has created or contributed to the creation of a state of affairs which he knows, or ought reasonably to know, has become life threatening, a consequent duty on him to act by taking reasonable steps to save the other's life will normally arise."

It was clear in the ruling that while the court focused on the fact that Evans had created or contributed to a dangerous situation, there was more than that. The fact that victim was young and defendants sister, along with the fact that they had left her to die at home, clearly all played a part in the ruling.

So while the Evans case is the exception, it is possible to find liability in drug cases through GNM although it isn't through unlawful act manslaughter as the causation cannot be found. In cases of GNM we can find that causation because that causation is found between defendants failure to act in other words the failure to call help after the victim has fallen ill. So the failure to act occurs after self-injection when the defendant realises that they have either created or contributed to a dangerous situation.

The final element of this definition of GNM is that the actions of the defendant must amount to gross negligence. What is then the difference between gross negligence and negligence?

In the case of *Misra*, it was held that it must include a risk of death. In the case of *Adomako* we get a more circular definition that says that the jury must consider 'whether having regard to the risk of death involved, the conduct â€¦ was so bad in all the circumstances to amount to a criminal act or omission'.

In other words, if the jury considers it to be criminal â€“ it will amount of gross negligence. But is the definition not circular? What makes negligence criminal is that it is gross; but what makes it gross is that it is criminal. So this has been puzzling for jury's as you can imagine.

In conclusion to GNM, just to recap as per *Adomako* (1994), the elements of GNM are:

- 1. Duty of care
- 2. Breach of duty
- 3. Whether that breach of duty caused the death of the victim
- 4. Breach of duty grossly negligent

Once you have listened to this lecture, you can participate in Forum discussions. There are a range of questions for you to discuss in the forum, some of these questions are more general, others more specific and law focussed. There is also a sample exam question.

The question on the screen you will see is a classic exam question on manslaughter from exams of 2017. It has two parts, one dealing with gross negligence manslaughter and another with constructive. Multi-part exam questions are common and it would be good to get into practice of trying them out. When you are practicing or trying out outlines or full answers to multi-part questions, always try to have equal detail in both or all of the parts of the question to ensure you answer the question fully.

As you are working through this particular question on the screen, please ensure you state the law as is relevant clearly and that you apply each element of the manslaughter in question to the scenario at hand. In particular in relation to both of these questions, do not forget to discuss the issue of causation.

**I**n summary, after this lecture you should be able to do the following:

- You should be able to describe different ways to commit involuntary manslaughter
- You should be able to explain the different elements required to find liability for unlawful act manslaughter and gross negligence manslaughter
- And finally, you should begin to explore the complexities involving causation, in particular in drug supply and suicide of another person.

We have come to the end of our Lecture on manslaughter. Now that you have listened to this lecture, please continue your reading on the topic by reading relevant chapters from the Module Guide and from William Wilson's textbook.

There will be a series of questions posted on the Laws VLE. The more you participate in this forum discussions, the more you will learn about the topic. So feel free to post your thoughts on the different questions. You can post answer outlines or even full answers to the past exam question that we just looked at too. Finally, I would strongly encourage you to read other people's posts. You can also comments on other students' posts, pose questions, and maybe have a lively discussion on the topic.

Thank you for listening to this Criminal law Lecture Plus on involuntary manslaughter.

## Sample examination question 1
**Question**

Eve encounters Douglas, a young boy, standing over Jenny outside Eve's house. Jenny, an old lady, is groaning on the floor. Having an excitable and impressionable disposition she concludes that he is robbing her. In fact he is attempting to help her get up after bumping into her accidentally. She takes a big swipe at him with her handbag. The handbag misses Douglas and hits Jenny. Jenny falls unconscious. Douglas runs off in a panic. Eve concludes, wrongly, that she has killed Jenny and decides to drag Jenny into her house to call an ambulance. On the garden path she trips over a stone sending Jenny flying onto a stone garden ornament. Jenny hits her head against the ornament and this kills her. Discuss.

**Tutor quidance**

Using the guidance below, think about how you would answer the question. When you are ready, read the feedback.

For a problem question you need to identify:

- 1. The offence to be charged. If there is a possibility of more than one offence deal with each in turn, concentrating upon the most plausible. In the case of more than one defendant each defendant must be considered separately.
- 2. Having identified the offence, state the definition of that offence and identify the issues. Do not laboriously go through each element of the offence in turn. Only discuss what is at issue, ie what counsel in court will be arguing about and what the judge will need to settle.
- 3. Discuss each issue in turn, explaining the difficulties of establishing any given element at issue and how these can be resolved.
- 4. Having decided whether the offence elements are made out then and only then consider whether any defence may be raised in answer to that offence.

Before writing, construct a skeleton argument following the template below:

- 1. Identify the harm which has occurred. Here it is Jenny's death
- 2. This allows you to identify the area of law = homicide.
- 3. Offence to be charged = manslaughter. (In the body of your answer you will need to state briefly that you will not consider murder as there is no evidence of mens rea.)

- 4. State the elements of constructive manslaughter. An unlawful act which caused death. (She will want to argue that the act causing death was not unlawful and that the first act of violence did not cause death. The final act of tripping was involuntary and the first act of hitting was in lawful self defence.)
- 5. Identify issues.
  - a. What unlawful act has she performed?
  - b. If assault, can she escape liability on the ground that her act was lawful as it was in self defence
  - c. And/or can she avoid liability on the ground that she did not intend to hit Jenny? (transferred malice)
  - d. Assuming (a) and (b) above are satisfied (see below) can she rely on the defence of self/defence (prevention of crime) although mistaken? (If she can this means that her use of force was lawful and therefore cannot form the basis of a homicide conviction?)
  - e. 'If she can, does the defence still operate when she mistakenly hits the wrong person (Jenny),e.g. Pagett.
  - f. Assuming her conduct in relation to Douglas/Jenny is unlawful can she escape liability on the ground that the act which killed Jenny was unaccompanied by mens rea (Thabo Meli, Le Brun).

**Feedback**
So your skeleton will look like this

- 1. Harm  =  Jenny's death.
- 2. Area of law = homicide.
- 3. Offence to be charged = manslaughter.
- 4. Type = constructive manslaughter.
- 5. Identify issues.
  - a. Is her act of wielding the handbag unlawful?
  - b. what is the crime? (Jennings).
  - c. If the crime is assault is the unlawfulness element satisfied or can she plead self defence which includes defence of another person - here Jenny.
  - d. Can she rely on the defence of self/defence prevention of crime although she was mistaken?
  - e. Can she avoid liability on the ground that she did not intend to hit Jenny (transferred malice)?
  - f. If she can, does the defence still operate when she mistakenly hits the wrong person (Jenny). e.g. Pagett.
  - g. Assuming her conduct in relation to Douglas/Jenny is unlawful, can she escape liability on the ground that the act that killed Jenny was unaccompanied by mens rea (Thabo Meli, Le Brun)?

- 6. If you conclude that constructive manslaughter is not available because her act was in lawful defence of Jenny then construct a similar skeleton for gross negligence manslaughter using a similar template down to issues. The issues will be:
  - Is her attempt to rescue Jenny so incompetent as to qualify as Adomako's gross negligence?

In the body of the essay all of these issues must be discussed in depth.

**Para 1 - introduction**

Start with an introduction which sets out your skeleton argument and then deal with each issue in turn. In this introduction you might briefly mention that Eve may have committed an assault on Douglas. As no issues arise in relation to the assault do not waste time dealing with it.

**Para 2**

The first issue that arises concerns the *actus reus* of constructive manslaughter. Eve will wish to argue that unlawful act manslaughter requires proof of an unlawful act that caused death but here the act (tripping) that caused death was involuntary and so arguably not the *actus reus* of homicide. Moreover, it was not an unlawful act because it was performed in defence of Jenny. There is also an issue of causation. This requires you to talk about cases such as Thabo Meli and Le Brun explaining that the chain of causation is not necessarily broken by a subsequent act of the attacker (here Jenny) reacting to the harm he has previously caused.

**Para 3**

The next issue is one of *mens rea*. Eve will wish to argue that the earlier act of wielding the handbag was unaccompanied by mens rea in relation to Jenny. She intended Jenny no harm. This will lead to a discussion of the principle of transferred malice.

**Para 4**

The next issue is whether she can raise the defence of self-defence/defence of others/prevention of crime. If she can, there can be no liability for unlawful act manslaughter. This requires discussion of the elements of selfdefence and how Eve will be treated on the facts as she believed them to be. Her belief does not have to be reasonable. If so, the prosecution will wish to argue that Eve mistakenly believed she was defending herself against an unlawful attack by Douglas not Jenny. Can she transfer her defence to meet the actus reus of the offence committed against Jenny?

## Exam question activity 1

Try to answer the following examination question:

Saskia and Barry had been married for many years when Saskia started to have an affair with Holmes, a work colleague from Barry's office. Despite Barry's pleas, his wife refused to give up her liaison with Holmes, so that eventually Barry left her. During his time away from home, Barry felt increasingly uncomfortable about the situation; he would constantly have nightmares where everyone shouted at him that he was a weak, pathetic man. During this time, he suffered from a deep depression, and sometimes felt very agitated and angry. A few weeks later, Barry returned to their marital home and was furious when he was that Holmes had moved in. Barry again begged his wife to end the affair, but she laughed in his face and told him how inadequate he was. A violent argument took place and ended when Barry picked up a carving knife in a rage, trembling, and went to the office to find Holmes. The drive took half an hour. When he found Holmes, Barry told him he needed to move out of his house immediately. Holmes laughed and said Saskia deserved a 'real man'. Barry then produced the knife, stabbed Holmes four times, then fled. Holmes died.

Discuss Barry's criminal liability for murder. Please pay special attention to the partial defences he might be able to rely on, and any case law relevant to the question.

A tip for the future! Use the following questions to structure your answer involving murder and partial defences:

- 1. Is D liable for murder? If yes, then proceed to consider:
- 2. Can D rely on the partial defence of loss of control?
- 3. Can D rely on the partial defence of diminished responsibility?
- 4. Conclude on whether D is liable for murder or whether he can rely on a partial defence and have his conviction reduced to manslaughter.

When you discuss partial defences, please set and apply all the elements in detail, discussing any case law relevant to the question.

Feedback is available but try to answer on your own first. Your response will not match the feedback exactly but you should compare your performance with it and consider whether you took all the relevant factors into account. Topic 7 - Exam question activity 1
