## Coincidence of actus reus and mens rea

Criminal liability usually requires the prosecution to establish:

- A did something which the law prohibits
- Was at fault in doing something which the law prohibits

## Correspondence Principle

- The fault element for Crime X (eg assault) cannot convict A for Crime Y(eg criminal damage).
- *Pembliton* (1874)

### Correspondence principle in operation 1

• W, intending to kill H's dog, Rover, puts poison in Rover's dog food. When H comes home later he is hungry. There is no food in the kitchen and so he eats the dog food which kills him. Is W guilty of murder?

### Correspondence principle in operation 2

• W, intending to kill H, puts poison in H's spaghetti bolognese. When H comes home later he is not hungry so he puts the food in Rover's food bowl. Rover eats the food which kills him. Is W guilty of criminal damage?

### Correspondence Principle; a qualification

- 1. If A is charged with Crime X (eg criminal damage) and has the fault element for crime Y (eg assault) he can still be convicted of Crime X if he also has the fault element for crime X
- *Pembliton*

2. Where the doctrine of transferred malice applies.
- *Gore* (1611)
- *Saunders and Archer* (1575)
- *Latimer* (1886)
- *Gnango* (2011)

## Transferred malice principle in operation

• W, intending to kill H puts poison in H's spaghetti bolognese and puts it in the oven . V, H and W' s daughter, arrives home early from work. Thinking the bolognese is for her she eats it and dies. Is W guilty of murder? ( a variation on *Saunders and Archer*)

## Temporal coincidence

• At the very moment A performs the conduct element of crime X he must have the mens rea for crime X

## Requirements of temporal coincidence

• W asks P, a hitman, to kill V, her husband. On the way to V's house where he intends to kill V he is involved in a car accident. The man in the other car is V, who is killed in the accident. P rubs his hands and gets back into the car and waits for his money. Is P guilty of murder?

## The Supposed Corpse cases

If act and mind do not coincide in time this is not always fatal.

- 1. Interpreting the conduct element as an omission, *Miller*(1983)
- 2. The continuing act doctrine *Fagan v MPC*(1969), *Santana-Bermudez* (2004)
- 3. The Supposed Corpse cases. *Thabo Meli*(1954) *Church* (1966), *LeBrun* (1992)

*Le Brun*

'It seems to us that where the unlawful application of force and the eventual act causing **death** are parts of the same sequence of events, the same transaction, the fact that there is an appreciable interval of time between the two does not serve to exonerate the defendant from liability.' Lord Lane CJ Le Brun

## Problem

Romeo and Juliet are married. One night, after both of them have been drinking heavily, Romeo and Juliet have an argument. Juliet smashes Romeo several times over the head with a paperweight. She then collapses in a drunken stupor. When Juliet awakes and sees Romeo unconscious on the floor, she regrets her action and decides to take Romeo to the hospital. Unfortunately, on the way out to her car, she drops him down the stairs. As a result of the injuries he sustained from the fall down the stairs, Romeo dies.
