## Murder

### **The big picture: social and cultural context of murder**
- Crime stats in 2024:
  - Police records: 8.8 million incidents of headline crime (which includes theft, robbery, criminal damage, fraud, computer misuse and violence with or without injury)
  - 1.4 million offences of violence with or without injury
  - 581 homicides
- Homicide comprises a very small proportion of overall crime
- However: it has great symbolic importance
  - The 'taboo' on death and killing
  - Social and cultural relevance of homicide

### **Defining murder**

- Common law offence
- Sir Edward Coke's definition of murder:
- "Murder is when a man of sound memory, and of the age of discretion, unlawfully killeth within any county of the realm any reasonable creature in *rerum natura* under the king's peace, with malice aforethought" (3 Inst. 47)
- In modern words, it is the unlawful killing of a human being under the King's peace with intent to kill or cause GBH

### **Elements of murder**

 *Actus reus*

• Unlawfully causing the death of a human being in the King's peace

 *Mens rea*

- Malice aforethought
- i.e., intention to kill or cause GBH: *Vickers* [1957] 2 QB 664


### *Actus reus* **of murder**

| Unlawfully                                                              | Causes death        | Human being                                                         | In the King's<br>peace              |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| • Killing is lawful if< justified in law,e.g., selfdefence,(necessity?) | •Rules of causation | •Must be expelled from the womb: Poultonm(1832) 5 C&P 329           |                                     |
|                                                                         |                     | • Must not bem"brain dead": Malcherek and Steel [1981] 2 AllmER 422 | • Exceptions apply during War       |

#### **Intention**

| Direct intent              | D's aim / purpose<br>D desires and foresees consequences<br>Moloney                                                                   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Oblique/indirect<br>intent | D does not aim for the consequence, but consequences are virtual certainly and D<br>appreciated it was a virtual certainty<br>Woollin |

#### **Murder - sentencing**

- Is murder the worst of crimes?
- Mandatory life sentence for murder still
- Death penalty abolished with the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 (now also under ECHR)

**What are the moral, legal, and ethical complexities of willful killing?**

**Complicating murder: armed forces in action**

**Complicating murder: Euthanasia and assisted dying**

- *Diane Pretty v Director of Public Prosecutions* [2001] UKHL 61 (HL)
- Euthanasia, as intentional killing, is considered murder
- Assisted Dying Bill 2025 a change in sight?

**Complicating murder: Women who kill abusive partners**

• *R v Challen* [2019] EWCA Crim 916)

**Complicating murder: the desire for punishment**

• *[R v Calocane](https://www.mentalhealthlaw.co.uk/R_v_Calocane_(2024)_EWCA_Crim_490)* [2024] [EWCA Crim 490](https://www.mentalhealthlaw.co.uk/R_v_Calocane_(2024)_EWCA_Crim_490)

#### **Murder summary**

- Murder is considered the most serious crimes
- Despite the severity of the charge, there is no statutory definition of murder
- High profile murder cases reveal ethical and moral ambiguity around prosecuting and sentencing murder


## II. Partial defences

### **The spectrum of homicide offences**

![](_page_18_Figure_1.jpeg)


### **Voluntary manslaughter**

Murder(Actus reus) -->  Voluntary manslaughter (partial deence on the basis of loss of control or diminished responsibility)

### **Loss of control**

There are three elements of loss of control under s.54(1), Coroners and Justice Act 2009:

- 1. Did D suffer a loss of control? (s.54(1)(a))
- 2. Was there a qualifying trigger? (s.54(1)(b))
  - "Fear" trigger s.55(3)
  - "Anger" trigger s.55(4)
  - Or a combination of them both is sufficient s.55(5)
- 3. Might a person of D's sex and age with a normal degree of tolerance and restraint and in the circumstances of D have reacted in the same or a similar way? (s.54(1)(c))

### **Element 1: loss of control**
- The killing resulted from D's loss of control
- It does not matter if loss of control was sudden (s 54(2))
- D must not act in considered desire for revenge
- Evidence of planninf and time delay will undermine Loc Jewell (2014)

### Element 2: qualifying trigger

A loss of self-control has qualifying trigger if...

- 1.attributable to D's fear of serious violence from V against D or another (s 55(3))
- 2.attributable to things done or said which—
- (a) were extremely grave, and
- (b) caused a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged. (s 55(4))

### **Limitations to triggers**

#### Incitement

- D must not have 'incited the thing to be done or said for the purpose of providing an excuse to use violence' (s55(6)(a) and (b))
- *R v Dawes*[2013] WLR 130

#### Sexual infidelity

- 'the fact that a thing done or said constituted sexual infidelity is to be disregarded' (s55(6)(c))
- *R v Clinton*[2012] EWCA Crim2 re-introduces infidelity?
- Relationship breakdown 'fraught with tension and difficulty, misunderstanding, potential for irrational fury'


### **Element 3: objective-ish test**

- The 'reasonable person' has become: a person of D's sex and age, with normal tolerance and self-restraint acting in the circumstances of D (s 54(1)(c))
- Individual characteristics (other than sex and age are excluded)
- A mental disorder may be a relevant to the gravity of the qualifying trigger but not to objective test, *Rejmanski* (2017)

### **Critical points about loss of control**

- Killings emerging from a sudden falling out any less heinous than killings which were the product of premeditation?
- New law was meant to replace much marred defence of provocation and gender imbalance but…
  - The so called 'jilted husbands' defence but excluding sexual infidelity has proven difficult (*R v Clinton* [2012] EWCA Crim 2)
  - Difficulty of responding to women who kill *R v Ahluwalia* (1993) 96 Cr App R 133

### **Diminished responsibility**

Introduced by s.2(1), Homicide Act 1957 (amended by s.52, Coroners and Justice Act 2009)

The **defendant** must prove that:

- i. He was suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning
- ii. Which arose from a recognised medical condition
- iii. And which substantially impaired the D' s ability to understand the nature of his conduct, form a rational judgment or exercise self-control
- iv. The abnormality of mental functioning must provide an explanation for D's conduct, which it will if it contributes significantly to D carrying out that conduct

### **Diminished responsibility: Elements 1 & 2**

- 1) Abnormality of mental functioning
- Old law: abnormality of mind
- 2) Recognised medical condition
- Covers recognised medical and psychiatric conditions so includes e.g., depression, personality disorder, schizophrenia
- World Health Organization + medical experts


### **Diminished responsibility: elements 3 and 4**

3) And which substantially impaired the D' s ability to understand the nature of his conduct, form a rational judgment or exercise self-control (1A)

- Substantial impairment a matter for medical testimony but also for jury
- Not merely mean 'more than trivial' (*R v Golds* [2016])
- Ordinary English word, question of degree; jury uses collective good sense

4) abnormality of mental functioning must provide an explanation for D's conduct, which it will if it contributes significantly to D carrying out that conduct

• Requires causal connection between the 'abnormality of mental functioning' and the killing

Partial defences to mitigate sentencing

You need to know both the defences and how they function

## III. Answering problem questions

### **Problem questions**

Tests: Knowledge and application of current law

Tests breadth of knowledge of several related issues

High marks: consisted, and detailed application of particularly case law

Evidence to use to back your answer: common law precedents and statutes


### **IRAC method**

- The IRAC method is a structured approach to legal reasoning. It helps you break down legal problems and provide clear, logical answers.
- **I Issue**
- **R Rule**
- **A Application**
- **C Conclusion**
- Using IRAC ensures that you address all necessary components of a legal problem systematically.

### **Tips for using IRAC**

Always refer to relevant case law and legislation.

Make sure your application is factspecific—don't just restate the rule.

Stay concise but thorough in each section.

Your conclusion should be supported by your analysis.

### **Sample question from 2024 exams**

Annie is married to Bert. Their relationship is volatile and Bert can be aggressive, and even violent, when he has been drinking alcohol. One evening, when Annie and Bert are out to dinner with Bert's colleagues, Bert is drinking heavily. Bert begins mocking Annie in front of his colleagues and keeps calling her a 'useless little wifey'. Later that evening, he makes advances to a female colleague in front of Annie and Annie storms out of the restaurant and goes for a walk. Annie returns home later that night to find Bert waiting for her. Bert immediately calls her a 'loser' for leaving the restaurant. When Annie tries to raise the issue of Bert's advances towards his female colleague in the restaurant, Bert bursts out laughing and says, 'there's plenty of women you don't even know about'. Outraged, Annie grabs a bottle of wine and throws it directly at Bert. Bert moves quickly to avoid being hit by the wine bottle and falls down, hitting his head on the corner of a table. Bert is unconscious and bleeding. Annie stands over him, and shouts, 'Finally you suffer too! You got what you deserve!' and leaves the house. The neighbours hear the commotion and call for an ambulance. The ambulance takes hours to arrive, and Bert dies of the injuries he sustained in the fall. Discuss Annie's liability for the death of Bert.
