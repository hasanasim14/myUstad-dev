## Part 1: Introduction to Actus Reus

### Criminal Liability

![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)

### An example of actus reus /mens rea

- Theft Act 1968, section 1 defines theft as:
- A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it.
- Can you identify mens rea and actus reus of theft?

### An example of actus reus /mens rea

| Actus reus                                              | Mens<br>rea                                     | 
|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| •< Appropriate< •<br>Property •Belonging to someoneelse | • Dishonesty • Intention to permanently deprive |  

• Theft Act 1968, section 1

A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it.

### Actus reus: Conduct

- Identifies the conduct which the criminal law considers harmful.
- The actus reus of an offence tells us what we can and cannot do: killing, damaging another's property, injuring another person are examples of forbidden kinds of conduct.
- By contrast the mens rea and defences enable us to decide whether the defendant was to blame for his wrongful acts.

### Actus reus: Conduct

- Conduct / body movement must be voluntary:
  - "No act is punishable if it is done involuntarily: and an involuntary act in this context… means an act which is done by the muscles without any control by the mind, such as a spasm, a reflex action or a convulsion; or an act done by a person who is not conscious of what he is doing, such as an act done whilst suffering from concussion or whilst sleepwalking… " Bratty v A-G for Northern Ireland [1961] 3 All ER 523 HL,

• Usually, an act but at times can be failure to act e.g. omission e.g. health and safety

### What are different elements of actus reus?

## Part 2: Omission liability

### Distinction between acts and omissions always clear?

- Airedale NHS Trust v Bland [1993] 2 WLR 316
- "I must however stress, at this point, that the law draws a crucial distinction between cases in which a doctor decides not to provide, or to continue to provide, for his patient treatment or care which could or might prolong his life, and those in which he decides, for example by administering a lethal drug, actively to bring his patient's life to an end."

### Omission liability

- No good Samaritan rule in England e.g. no general duty to act!
- Duty to act arises only very specific set of circumstances:
  - 1. The conduct element of the crime in question must be capable of commission by omission.
  - 2. The circumstances must be such as to create a legal duty to act.
  - 3. The defendant's failure to act must be in breach of that duty.
  - 4. The defendant's failure to act must be voluntary.
  - 5. The harm must be caused by the omission.

## Part 3: Causation

### Result crimes & causation

- For result crimes there needs to be a causal link between D's actions and the result, this is called **"chain of causation"**
- **For example, D stabs the V (action) and V dies (result)**

### **Causation: three things to remember**

![](_page_17_Figure_1.jpeg)

### **Causation in fact**

- Hart and Honoré describe a factual cause as: "an event or act which 'makes the difference' between something happening and something not happening". (Causation and the law. (1959))
- "But for" test *White* [1910] 2 KB 124
- Would the result have occurred 'but for' the conduct of the accused?

### **Causation in law**

- Was D's act/omission a 'substantial and operating' cause of V's death?: *Benge* (1865) 4 F & F 504
- D's act/omission need not be the sole cause, as long as it 'contributes significantly': *Pagett* (1963) 75 Cr App R 279

 Did anything break the chain of causation?

- This comes under legal causation but it can be helpful to consider it as separately as most complex part of legal causation
- If D's conduct is substantial and operative cause despite any intervening event, D is still criminally liable
- Novus actus interveniens (NAI) or new intervening acts can be divided into:
  - A) third party interventions
  - B) victim interventions
  - C) naturally occurring events interventions and

**NAI Case study: *Pagett***

- Acts of third parties exacerbating the harm
- *R v Pagett* (1983) 76 Cr App R 279

**NAI: Medical interventions**

- Traditionally medical treatment needed to be palpably wrong to break the chain of causation (Jordan (1956) 40 Cr App R 152)
- Key case: R v Cheshire [1991] 1 WLR 844
  - Intervening medical treatment could only be regarded as excluding the responsibility of the defendant if it was so independent of the defendant's act and so potent in causing the death, that the jury regard the defendant's acts as insignificant.
  - See Activity 4.8 in study guide

**NAI: Victim interventions**

- Victim interventions can break the chain of causation if unforeseen by D and unforeseeable by a reasonable person (R v Roberts [1972] 5 Cr App R; Dear [1996] Crim LR 595
- But remember that D, must take victims as he finds them (Blaue [1975] 1 WLR <sup>1411</sup>)
- If V's actions are voluntary, i.e. free, deliberate and informed, unlike to amount to an intervention

**NAI: Naturally occurring events**

# Part 4: Preview of a past exam question

## Past exam question

Explain and discuss critically the approach of the criminal law to the following cases with reference to the question as to whether A was under a duty to rescue. DO NOT discuss any offences which may have been committed.

(a) A is a swimming pool attendant. He sees V, a swimmer, struggling out of her depth in the pool. (b) A is the mother of V. She sees V struggling out of her depth in the pool.

(c) A is the 20-year-old son of V. He sees V struggling out of her depth in the pool.

(d) A is the owner of the swimming bath. She sees V struggling out of her depth in the pool.

(e) A is the mother of T, aged 10, who has invited his friend V, also aged 10, to go swimming with him at the local pool. A sees V struggling out of his depth in the pool.

(f) A and V are an unmarried couple who live together. A sees V struggling out of his depth in the pool.

(g) A, who is supervising her child at a swimming pool, drops an ice cream accidentally at the poolside. V, a child, slips on the ice cream and falls into the pool. A sees V struggling out of her depth in the pool.

- Actus reus is a fundamental principle of criminal law that you should be aware of and able to apply in relation to all the offences you come across in your study
- Omission liability is an important part of criminal law that poses both practical and theoretical dilemmas
- Causation is an essential part of result crimes, requiring you to know rules on factual causation, legal causation, and new intervening acts
