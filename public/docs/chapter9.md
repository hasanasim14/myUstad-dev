### **Introduction**

Non-fatal offences against the person take two forms. The first and most obvious form involves **crimes of violence**. The criminal wrongdoing for such crimes is the causing of physical harm to another. Proof of physical harm is, therefore, an essential ingredient of these offences and, equally importantly, the offences may be committed irrespective of the victim's consent. The state takes the view that causing people physical harm is inherently wrong and, with some obvious exceptions such as surgery, the consent of the victim does not make it right.

The second form involves **crimes against autonomy**. The criminal wrongdoing for such crimes is the undesired interference with the victim's autonomy or freedom of action. The essence of these crimes is that the victim does not consent to the contact, rather than any harm which may have resulted. So, for example, if A (an adult) kisses B (another adult), this will be an offence **only if B does not consent** to the kiss. However, If A (an adult) punches B (another adult) in the course of an informal fight, **breaking B's nose**, this will be an offence **even though B does consent** to the punch since physical harm has occurred which cannot be consented to.

**page 109**
### 9.1 Crimes against autonomy**

We shall start with crimes against autonomy. Autonomy means freedom to control one's own life, body and actions. The most common criminal interferences with autonomy include common assault, false imprisonment and rape. In this chapter we shall examine only common assault.

#### **Common assault**

Common assault comprises two separate offences: assault and battery (also known as assault by beating). The difference between the two is simple. Battery (assault by beating) involves an unconsented-to application of **force**; assault (simple assault) involves the unconsummated threat thereof. Punching someone is a battery; threatening to do so is an assault. Usually, both offences will be committed at the same time, e.g. by A threatening to hit B before they deliver the blow. It is possible, however, for the offences to be committed singly (e.g. by threatening to hit someone without consummating the threat or by hitting someone from behind).

Failure to charge the right offence will result in the case being thrown out (*R (Kracher)* v *Leicester Magistrates' Court* [2013] EWHC 4627 (Admin)).

Assault and battery are offences in their own right as well as being ingredients in other offences, such as assault occasioning actual bodily harm and assault with intent to rob. They were originally common law offences but have been made statutory offences by s.39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. The principles governing the offences are still to be found in case law. This includes both the criminal law and the law of tort (trespass to the person). They are triable only summarily with a maximum sentence of six months' imprisonment.

Do not allow yourself to be confused over terminology. The phrase 'common assault' refers to both assault and battery. So to say 'A assaulted B' can mean either that A hit B or that A threatened to hit B. However, it is always best to identify the type of common assault you are dealing with for purposes of clarity. You may wish to follow the lead of Glanville Williams (*Textbook of criminal law.* (London: Stevens & Sons,1983) second edition [ISBN 9780420468604]) who distinguishes the two forms by referring to battery as 'physical assault' and assault as 'psychic' assault.

#### **9.1.1 Assault**

The first form of common assault is assault, properly so called, or – as Williams calls it – 'psychic' assault or simple assault. It requires no physical contact with the person of the victim. It was defined in *Venna* [1975] 3 All ER 788 as:

A person is guilty of assault if he intentionally or recklessly leads someone to apprehend the application to his body of immediate unlawful force.

##### *Actus reus***: assault**

 **Causing apprehension**

The *actus reus* of simple assault is acting so as to lead another to apprehend an immediate unlawful contact. To apprehend means simply to 'expect'. It does not specifically require 'fear' although fear will normally be present. In *Savage and Parmenter*, the House of Lords, approving *Venna*, underlined the fact that the offence was constituted by the fact of V apprehending the application to his body of immediate unlawful force.

##### **Activity 9.1**

**Read Wilson, Section 11.3.A.1 'Assault' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. A points a gun at B and threatens to shoot B. B, but not A, knows the gun is not loaded. Is there an assault?**
- **b. A points a gun at B and threatens to shoot B. A, but not B, knows the gun is not loaded. Is there an assault?**

**page 110**
##### **Immediacy**

The definition refers to the apprehension of 'immediate force'. Until recently, immediacy was of the essence; in short, some form of physical confrontation was necessary. For this reason it was not an assault if D threatened V with future harm (*Halliday*), or threatened V from afar, or otherwise was unable to put their threat into immediate execution. So in *Thomas* v *NUM* [1986] Ch 20, a civil case, it was not an assault when picketing mineworkers made threatening gestures to strike-breaking colleagues who were being brought to the colliery in vehicles under police escort, as there was no immediate prospect of converting the threat into action. It would have been different if the picketing miners had thrown stones or produced guns.

In recent years, this requirement of immediacy has been gradually attenuated, largely on the ground that the wrongdoing component of an assault is the effect the threat has on the victim rather than the reasonableness of the victim's fear. Fear, after all, often produces irrational thoughts. So in *Smith* v *Chief Constable of Woking* (1983) 76 Cr App R 234, D, late one night, peered through the curtains of V's apartment. This frightened V considerably and she called the police. D argued that he was not guilty of an assault as he had done nothing which would put V in fear of **immediate** personal violence. This argument was rejected on the basis that D's action was likely to instil fear of potential violence, even though objectively his position outside the apartment made this physically impossible. Kerr LJ said:

What else, other than some form of immediate violence, could [V] have been terrified about?...When one is in a state of terror one is very often unable to analyse precisely what one is frightened of as likely to happen next. When I say that, I am speaking of a situation such as the present, where the person who causes one to be terrified is immediately adjacent, albeit on the other side of a window…It was clearly a situation where the basis of the fear which was instilled in her was that she did not know what the defendant was going to do next, but that, whatever he might be going to do next, and sufficiently immediately for the purposes of the offence, was something of a violent nature.

This kind of behaviour is now a separate statutory offence under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. But the effect of the case may well have been to change the application of the law in cases such as *Thomas* v *NUM*. The leading authority on the matter is *Ireland* [1998] AC 147. In this case D made a number of phone calls to V: some included threats, others were silent. The House of Lords concluded, consistently with *Smith* v *Woking*, that the ingredients of assault were present, whether or not words were used, so long as the jury was convinced that D's phone calls led V to expect immediate personal violence and this did not require a face-to-face confrontation between D and V. Another important consequence of this case is to rid the law of any doubt that assault could not be committed by words alone. It can. Indeed, even a silent telephone call is an assault if it leads V to apprehend immediate personal violence.

The effect of this House of Lords' decision is to relax the immediacy requirement quite considerably. In *Constanza* [1997] 2 Cr App R 492, the Court of Appeal held that even sending threatening letters could form the subject matter of an assault. On the question of immediacy, it sufficed that D's actions provoked a fear of violence **at some time not excluding the immediate future**.

##### **Activity 9.2**

**Read question (b) in Activity 9.9. Do you understand why Adam was not guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm? The answer is that Adam did not provoke a fear of violence in Eve and so did not commit (psychic) assault. Clearly there was no battery either.**

**Unlawful force**

The force or threat of force must be unlawful, so no offence is committed if D is acting in self-defence, or if the show of force was done to effect a lawful arrest (s.3(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1967 (CLA 1967)) or the approach is consented to. So in *Cousins* [1982] 2 All ER 115, it was said that a threat to kill was capable of being a lawful exercise of self-

**page 111**
defence in discouraging a threatened attack and so would not be an assault. So also, if A permits B (a circus knife thrower) to throw a knife at her, which he does, no assault is committed due to A's consent, even though A apprehends the possibility of being struck.

 ***Mens rea*****: assault**

The *mens rea* for common assault of this kind is intention or common law recklessness; that is, foresight that V will apprehend the application of unlawful force. In *Spratt* [1990] 1 WLR 1073, D fired an air pistol through the window of his flat for no particular reason. Two pellets hit a girl playing in the forecourt, whom D had not known was there. D was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm (s.47 OAPA 1861). The Court of Appeal quashed his conviction. To be guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm the prosecution had to prove **both** the bodily harm **and** an assault that had caused it. It could prove the former but not the latter, since to be guilty of an assault it had to be proven that D intended to hit the girl (battery) or cause her to fear being hit (assault), or foresight of either these two alternatives. It could do this only if D had known the girl was there.

#### **9.1.2 Battery or assault by beating**

Battery can be defined as:

any act by which D, intentionally or recklessly, inflicts (non-consensual) unlawful force upon P.

##### *Actus reus:* **battery**

**Force**

As has been explained, the wrongdoing in common assault, including battery, otherwise known as 'assault by beating', is not causing physical harm but causing unwanted interference with the person of the victim whether or not physical harm is caused. In battery this takes the form of someone applying force to the victim, or – putting it another way – making physical contact with them. So examples of battery include restraining a person (*Collins* v *Wilcock* [1984] 1 WLR 1172), digging them in the ribs, spitting on them (*Commonwealth* v *Cohen* 55 Mass App Ct 358 (2002)), cutting their hair (*DPP* v *Smith* (2006)), even, it appears, cutting (*Day* (1845) 1 Cox CC 207) or feeling a person's clothes while on their person.

The physical contact does not have to be painful or hurtful but it does have to involve force. So it is not battery to drug, poison or gas someone: such interferences should be charged as an offence under s.23 OAPA 1861.

A battery requires an act. In other words it may not be committed by omission. So a tree surgeon who, without fault, allows a tree branch to fall, pinning a passer-by to the ground, does not commit battery by failing to remove the branch. One qualification to this rule is the continuing act doctrine. This refers to cases where the defendant's failure to act can be construed as continuing an earlier act. In *Fagan* v *MPC* [1968] 3 All ER 442, it was an assault for a driver to fail to remove his car from a policeman's foot, having first parked it there without fault. The court ruled that this was not an omission but a continuation of the initial act of parking. Put another way, F was not 'omitting' to remove the car from the foot. He was 'keeping' the car on the foot just as he would have been doing if, having stepped on the policeman's foot by mistake, he then refused to step off again. The requirement that there be an act was reaffirmed in *Dunn* (2015) which was considered in Chapter 3 of this module guide.

##### **Activity 9.3**

**If F had only learned about the plight of the policeman having left the car, would his refusal to remove the car still be a continuation of the initial act of parking the car? Would the tree surgeon, considered above, be guilty of battery on this basis?' No feedback provided.**

**page 112**
##### **Is direct contact necessary?**

It is not necessary for there to be direct contact between D and V. In the old case of *Scott* v *Shepherd* (1773) 95 ER 1124, D was found guilty of battery when he had thrown a lit firework into a crowded marketplace. The firework exploded in V's face, but only after it had passed through several hands before it arrived there. The court ruled that this did not affect D's liability. Again, it was a battery for a practical joker to shout 'Fire!' at a theatre production, resulting in injuries to members of the audience trapped in the resulting crush (*Martin* (1881) 8 QBD 54).

So also in *Mitchell* [1983] 2 All ER 427, D assaulted V by pushing T roughly, who then fell on top of V. However, it is arguably not a battery if A digs a pit for B to fall into, as B's fall is not the result of A applying any force. The case of *DPP* v *K* (*A Minor*) (1990) 91 Cr App R 23 runs counter to this conclusion. K, a schoolboy, loaded a hand dryer in the school lavatories with acid. The next user, V, was injured when it discharged on to him. The Queen's Bench Division was satisfied that this was a battery. But what force did K apply directly or indirectly to V? Presumably the force of the acid hitting his person.

##### **Activity 9.4**

**Read Wilson, Section 11.3.A.2 'Battery' and answer the following question. What was the act of assault relied upon in** *DPP* **v** *Santana-Bermudez* **(2003)? What problem does the case create?**

##### **Unlawful force**

The force or threat of force must be unlawful; so, as with assault, no offence is committed if D is acting in self-defence, or the contact is consented to (*Slingsby* [1995] Crim LR 570) or if the show of force was done to effect a lawful arrest (s.3(1) CLA 1967). So in *Kenlin* v *Gardiner* [1966] 3 All ER 931, police officers were suspicious of the activities of two boys and took hold of them to prevent them running away. They struggled and punched the officers. The boys appealed against their convictions for assault at the Magistrates' Court. The Queen's Bench Divisional Court held that, since the boys were not arrested, the taking hold of them was an assault by the officers. The boys were allowed to use reasonable force in self-defence against an assault, and their convictions were quashed.

Compare this case with *Donnelly* v *Jackman* [1970] 1 All ER 987, 134 JP 352 where, on similar facts, the officer tapped D on the shoulder with the intention of stopping him. D then punched the officer. On appeal against conviction, the Divisional Court upheld D's conviction. Tapping D on the shoulder was a trivial interference with his autonomy and did not take the officer outside the exercise of his duty. This case shows that not every unconsented-to contact is a battery. Unconsented-to contacts issuing from the ordinary rough and tumble of everyday life do not count as batteries so long as the force used was not excessive (*Collins* v *Wilcock* [1984] 1 WLR 1172). This will include such contacts as taps on the shoulder to attract another's attention, slaps on the back in greeting, jostling, knocking and bumping in queues, on trains and while running for the bus.

However, contrary to some earlier authorities, there is no requirement that the touching be hostile. If V makes clear that they refuse a particular kind of contact, D will commit battery if they ignore the refusal, however well intentioned. A surgeon who discovers cancer in the womb of an anaesthetised woman on whom he is a performing a dilation and curettage acts unlawfully if, without gaining the woman's consent, he performs a hysterectomy.

##### *Mens rea***: battery**

The *mens rea* for battery, as with assault, is intention and recklessness as to the unlawful contact. It is not intention or recklessness as to any resulting harm. It is for this reason that in *Slingsby* (1995) D was not guilty of manslaughter, because, although he may have foreseen some injury to his partner, he did not have the *mens rea* for battery. The *actus reus* of battery is the application of unconsented-to force: the *mens rea* is the intention to apply (or foresight regarding) unconsented-to force.

**page 113**
#### 9.1.3 Charging common assault**

We have seen that actual physical harm is not of the essence of battery. However, most cases of battery will inevitably result in some physical harm. The question for the prosecuting authorities is, therefore, whether to charge such a case as common assault or the aggravated version, assault occasioning actual bodily harm (s.47 OAPA 1861). The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has published charging standards for the guidance of prosecutors. These state that batteries causing minor bruises and cuts, abrasions, swellings, broken nose, loss or breaking of teeth and black eyes are appropriately charged as common assaults. More serious injuries, such as also appear in the charging standards, are chargeable under s.47 and s.20 OAPA 1861. The charging standards do not have the force of law but do help to explain why cases are charged as they are. Why do you think a prosecutor may 'undercharge' in this way?

### **9.2 Crimes of violence**

The crimes of violence dealt with in this module guide are those appearing in the OAPA 1861. These offences form a ladder of relative seriousness starting from, at the bottom of the ladder, assault occasioning bodily harm (s.47), to malicious wounding (s.20), up to wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (GBH) (s.18). We shall deal with these in ascending order of gravity, starting with the least serious.

#### **9.2.1 Assault occasioning actual bodily harm**

Section 47 OAPA 1861 makes it an offence to commit an assault **occasioning actual bodily harm**. To support a conviction for s.47 the prosecution must therefore establish:

- a common assault
- actual bodily harm
- a causal connection (occasioning) between the assault and the harm.

##### **Common assault**

The elements of common assault have been dealt with above. You will remember that an assault comprises two alternative forms of wrongdoing. The first is an unconsummated threat of unlawful force to another person ('psychic' or 'simple' assault). The second is the actual application of unlawful force to the body of another. This is known as a battery, assault by beating or 'physical' assault. The prosecution can establish the s.47 offence, therefore, if it can prove actual bodily harm was caused as a result of **either** D threatening an unlawful contact or actually making such contact.

##### **Illustration 9.1**

- **a. A punches B (battery), breaking B's nose (causing actual bodily harm).**
- **b. A, intending to throw beer at V, accidentally lets go of the glass (causing), which hits (battery) and cuts C (actual bodily harm) (***Savage* **[1992] 1 AC 699).**
- **c. A makes an unwelcome advance to V, a passenger in the back of B's car (simple assault). V, in fear, jumps out of the car, breaking her leg (causing actual bodily harm) (***Roberts* **(1972) 56 Cr App R 95).**

##### **Actual bodily harm**

Actual bodily harm was defined rather loosely by Swift J in *Donovan* [1934] 2 KB 498 as:

any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the [victim]. Such hurt or injury need not be permanent, but must...be more than merely transient and trifling.

The jury is the arbiter of fact as to whether the 'hurt' suffered by V is 'actual bodily harm'. Any injury which is not trivial is theoretically 'bodily harm'. In practice, s.47 is unlikely to be charged unless the degree of injury is fairly substantial. Assaults causing minor scratches and bruises tend to be charged as common assault. Actual bodily harm does not, however, require injury to living tissue. The Divisional Court has included the cutting of a woman's ponytail as actual bodily harm, although the hair is technically 'dead tissue' (*DPP* v *Smith* [2006] EWHC 94 (Admin)).

**page 114**
##### **Activity 9.5**

**Read Wilson, Section 11.4.A 'Assault occasioning actual bodily harm' and complete the following activity.**

**List examples of actual bodily harm to be found in the Crown Prosecution Service charging standards. These standards do not have the force of law but they are influential in practice. You can use them to guide your own choice of which crimes to charge in problem answers.**

Actual bodily harm has been defined to include psychiatric injury. In *Chan Fook* [1994] 1 WLR 689, the Court of Appeal ruled that this did not include simply shock, pain or panic; a recognised psychiatric illness is necessary. In *Ireland* and *Burstow*, two women who suffered panic disorder (chronic panic attacks) and depressive illness as a result of being persistently stalked by the defendants were ruled to have suffered 'bodily' harm for the purposes of both s.47 and s.20 (see below). *Ireland* is authority for two separate propositions.

-  A telephone call, even a silent telephone call, can constitute a common assault.
-  If psychiatric injury is suffered as a result the assault can be charged as assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

If the psychiatric injury suffered is severe, the assault can be charged, under s.20, as the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm. See *Burstow*, below.

##### **The causal connection**

Section 47 refers to assault 'occasioning' actual bodily harm. 'Occasioning' simply means 'causing'. To secure a conviction for s.47, as opposed to common assault, therefore, the prosecution must prove an unbroken causal chain linking the victim's injury with the defendant's assault (or battery). The test for causation requires simply that the victim's actions were a factual and legal cause of the common assault. The factual cause will be the legal cause if it substantially contributed to the resulting harm and if there was no *novus actus interveniens* (see Chapter 4).

So in *Roberts* (1972) 56 Cr App R 95, D touched V on the knee. Fearing a sexual attack, V jumped out of the car. Was D guilty of a common assault only or of the s.47 offence? D argued that he should not be guilty of the aggravated offence, only the common assault because he did not cause the victim's injury; she did by jumping out of the car. The court ruled that, since her reaction was not abnormal, the causal chain linking assault and physical harm remained intact. *Roberts* was approved in *Savage* [1992] 1 AC 699, in which D threw a pint of beer in V's face. The glass slipped and cut V. The House of Lords held that it was not necessary for the prosecution to prove actual foresight of harm for D to be guilty under s.47:

The verdict of assault occasioning actual bodily harm may be returned upon proof of an assault together with proof of the fact that actual bodily harm was occasioned by the assault.

##### *Mens rea***: s.47**

The *mens rea* for s.47 requires, therefore, only an intention to cause apprehension of physical contact or an intention to apply (unlawful) force to the victim (or foresight of either). It is not necessary to prove D intended or foresaw the injury. So in *Roberts* it was not necessary for the prosecution to prove that D foresaw any injury, as long as he intended to touch V or foresaw her apprehension. Proving culpability requires proof of foresight: proving cause does not. Again, in *Savage*, where V was injured by a beer glass, the offence was made out upon proof that D intended to throw beer at V. It was not necessary to show further any foresight that the beer glass might slip from her grasp and cause the resulting cut.

**page 115**
##### **Activity 9.6**

**Read Wilson, Sections 11.3 'Offences protecting personal autonomy' and 11.4 'Crimes of violence' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. Adam and Eve are partners. One day Eve starts tickling Adam. He asks her to stop but she refuses and so Adam jumps over the sofa and falls awkwardly, breaking his ankle. Has Eve committed assault occasioning actual bodily harm?**
- **b. Eve is an asthmatic. Adam, who knows this, steals her inhaler. He then telephones her to tell her what he has done. Eve asks for its return but Adam refuses, although he foresees that this might cause her to have a panic attack, which in turn would precipitate an asthma attack. This is indeed what happens and Eve is rushed to hospital. In attempting to remedy her condition an overdose of a palliative drug is given which sends Eve into a coma. She regains consciousness a few days later with no ill effects. What offence(s), if any, has Adam committed?**

**Hint: In question (b), Adam cannot be guilty under s.47. Do you know why? If you do, and you understand what he may be guilty of, you are a long way down the road to a good understanding of this area.** 

#### **9.2.2 Malicious wounding/infliction of grievous bodily harm**

Malicious wounding is on the next rung up in the hierarchy of gravity. Under s.20 of the OAPA 1861, an offence is committed where D:

unlawfully and maliciously wound[s] or inflict[s] any grievous bodily harm, upon any other person, either with or without any weapon or instrument.

##### *Actus reus***: s.20**

It is important to understand that there are two different conduct elements in s.18 (and s.20). The first is a wounding; the second is causing grievous bodily harm. These are by no means synonymous. It is possible to wound someone without them suffering grievous bodily harm. And it is possible to inflict grievous bodily harm on someone without wounding them. **It is key to your proper understanding of this offence and section 20 below that you understand and remember this point**.

##### **Illustration 9.2**

- **a. D, wanting to seriously hurt V, takes a carving knife and thrusts it towards V's abdomen. V sidesteps and the knife catches him on the arm, causing significant bleeding.**
- **b. D smashes V over the head with an iron bar. This causes a fracture to V's skull.**

Both these cases support a conviction under s.20. In the first case, there is a wounding **without grievous bodily harm**, whereas in the second there is an infliction of grievous bodily harm **but no wounding**. In practice, trivial wounds such as Illustration 9.2(a) tend to be charged under s.47 in the absence of an intention to cause serious injury.

The way this offence has been fashioned, therefore, encompasses an enormous potential range of degrees of injury, from a trivial wound to a life-endangering beating. Both are subject to the same maximum punishment of five years. In the next two sections we will examine what is meant by a wounding and what is meant by grievous bodily harm together with their points of overlap and difference.

##### **Wounding**

A wound requires more than a scratch or a graze, even though blood may show. It requires a penetration of both layers of skin – namely the dermis and epidermis. Internal ruptures do not count as a wound, nor does bruising, despite the blood loss (*McLoughlin* (1838) 173 ER 651). In *Eisenhower* [1984] QB 331, D shot V with an air gun and the pellet hit V near the eye, resulting in a bruise below the eyebrow and a bloodshot eye. D was charged under s.20, whose *actus reus* is similar to that of s.18. The injury

**page 116**
satisfied neither form of the *actus reus* of s.20: it was insufficiently serious to count as grievous and nor did it count as a wound, because a wound is a break in the continuity of the skin. In short, an internal rupturing of the blood vessels, as here, is not a wound. This should have been charged as a s.47 offence.

Note that there is one exception to the rule that internal ruptures do not count as a wound; this is where the internal membrane ruptured takes the form of skin, as in the lining of the mouth and the urethra (*Waltham* (1849) 3 Cox 442).

#### **9.2.3 Grievous bodily harm**

Most commentators believe it is time to dispense with words such as 'grievous' with which the 1861 Act is littered. It really is not helpful to clarity. *DPP* v *Smith* [1961] AC 290 defined grievous bodily harm as 'really serious bodily harm or injury'. I think you will agree that this is not a particularly helpful elaboration. No more helpful is *Janjua* [1999] 1 Cr App R 91, in which the Court of Appeal ruled that 'serious harm' is a good enough paraphrase of grievous bodily harm to be given to the jury. Whether an injury counts as 'really serious' or 'serious' is a question of fact for the jury. In *Bollom* [2003] EWCA Crim 2846, the Court of Appeal said that, in deciding whether harm was serious or not, the jury should take into account the age and state of physical fitness of the victim, as well as the extent and nature of the injury. It is fair to say therefore that what would be 'serious injury' for one person might not be for another. Breaking an office worker's index finger may not be considered a serious injury but the jury may consider it differently if the victim was a concert pianist.

In practice, the jury's task is made easier by the filtering mechanism of the Crown Prosecution Service charging standards. These offer guidance to the prosecution as to what kind of injuries count as grievous for the purpose of deciding which offence to charge. Serious wounds count as grievous bodily harm; so does breaking an arm or leg, savage beatings, knocking someone unconscious for more than a brief period, injuries involving permanent disfigurement or long-term treatment and those involving serious loss of blood or requiring surgery. Grievous bodily harm also includes sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV (*Dica* [2004] EWCA Crim 1103) and serious psychiatric injury (*Burstow* [1997] 1 Cr App R 144).

##### **Grievous bodily harm must be 'inflicted'**

Until recently 'inflict' was thought to be narrower than 'cause' (the *actus reus* element in s.18). 'Inflicting grievous bodily harm' conjures up the vision of some form of application of force that delivers the harm, just as a knife or gun delivers a wound. This is supported by the presence in s.20 of the words 'either with or without any weapon or instrument', which implies some form of harm-delivering blow or application of force. This was the view taken in *Clarence* (1888) 22 QBD 23 where it was held that a husband who gave gonorrhoea to his wife during consensual intercourse was not guilty under s.20; he had caused GBH but not inflicted it. He had not inflicted GBH because he had not assaulted her, and he had not assaulted her because she consented to the intercourse. *Clarence* also stood for the proposition that for s.20 the harm must be delivered by force in the manner of a shot from a gun, a thrust with a knife or a blow from a stick. In *Burstow*, *Clarence* was disapproved. In this case, D had stalked his victim over a long period: he had made silent telephone calls, sent hate mail, followed her around and stolen clothing from her washing line. V suffered serious clinical depression as a result. The House of Lords held that serious depression counted as grievous bodily harm, just as depression counted as actual bodily harm. Such harm could be inflicted in the absence of the application of force. It is not that kind of harm. It was said that there was no meaningful difference between inflicting harm and causing harm. If this is the case then if *Clarence* were decided today, the husband would be guilty under s.20. In *Dica* this was confirmed. D had intercourse with V without informing her that he was HIV positive. V contracted the virus. It was held that a serious sexually transmitted disease counted as serious bodily injury and that D had inflicted it. There was no requirement that the harm be delivered by any unlawful force as *Clarence* had supposed. To inflict harm means simply to cause it, which D had done.

**page 117**
One distinction between 'cause' and 'inflict' may, however, remain. Cause is possibly slightly wider in that one can cause someone serious harm by omission, say by omitting to put out a fire that one has accidentally started, which results in injury to the victim (see *Miller*). It is not yet clear whether one can inflict serious harm by omission. In *Burstow* it was said that it is simply a matter of correct linguistic usage. If so, it is arguable that, although it is certainly correct linguistic usage to say that D 'caused' V serious injury by failing to put the fire out, it is not so obviously correct usage to say that D 'wounded' or 'inflicted serious harm' on V (her son) by failing to stop V from injuring himself on a barbed wire fence. The words 'wound' and 'inflict', in other words, seem to imply the need for some form of action. However there is no authority in support of this proposition so it should be treated with caution.

##### *Mens rea***: s.20**

The *mens rea* for s.20 OAPA 1861 is malice; that is, intention or subjective recklessness. In *Mowatt* [1968] 1 QB 421, the Court of Appeal ruled that it was necessary to prove that D intended or foresaw harm befalling V but it was not necessary to intend or foresee the degree of harm actually sustained. In *Parmenter* [1991] 2 WLR 408 the House of Lords approved *Mowatt*, concluding that the prosecution need prove only that D intended or foresaw the risk of some physical harm resulting from his shaking of his child for a conviction under s.20. It was not necessary to show that D intended or foresaw that the child would suffer serious injury.

#### **9.2.4 Wounding with intent**

By s.18 of the OAPA 1861 it is an offence to:

unlawfully and maliciously by any means whatsoever wound or cause any grievous bodily harm to any person, with intent to do some grievous bodily harm to any person, or with intent to resist or prevent (arrest)...

The major difference between this offence and that of s.20 OAPA 1861 lies in the *mens rea*. Section 18 is a crime of specific intent whereas s.20 can be committed either intentionally or recklessly.

##### *Actus reus***: s.18**

It is again important to understand that there are two alternative conduct elements in s.18. The first is a wounding; the second is an infliction of grievous bodily harm (see the discussion on s.20 above).

##### **Wounding**

A wound requires more than a scratch or a graze, even though blood may show. It requires a penetration of both layers of skin – namely the dermis and epidermis. Internal ruptures do not count as a wound, nor does bruising, despite the blood loss (*McLoughlin* (1838) 173 ER 651). In *Eisenhower* [1984] QB 331, D shot V with an air gun and the pellet hit V near the eye, resulting in a bruise below the eyebrow and a bloodshot eye. D was charged under s.20, whose *actus reus* is similar to that of s.18. The injury satisfied neither form of the *actus reus* of s.20: it was insufficiently serious to count as grievous and nor did it count as a wound, because a wound is a break in the continuity of the skin. In short, an internal rupturing of the blood vessels, as here, is not a wound. This should have been charged as a s.47 offence.

Note that there is one exception to the rule that internal ruptures do not count as a wound; this is where the internal membrane ruptured takes the form of skin, as in the lining of the mouth and the urethra (*Waltham* (1849) 3 Cox 442).

#### **9.2.5 Grievous bodily harm**

##### **Grievous bodily harm**

For the meaning of 'grievous bodily harm', see Section 9.2.3.

**page 118**
The cases referred to above in relation to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (*Dica)* and serious psychiatric injury (*Burstow*) were decided in the context of the s.20 offence. It will be rare for such transmissions to be charged under s.18 because of the difficulty of proving to prove the intent necessary.

##### **Causing grievous bodily harm**

We have dealt with the concept of cause before. Again, to remember what it is to cause harm means you may need to revisit Chapter 4 of this module guide. Harm can be caused by an act, or an omission in breach of duty (e.g. *Pittwood* (1902) 19 TLR 37, *Instan* [1893] 1 QB 450, *Evans* [2009] EWCA Crim 2243). The reference in s.18 to 'any means whatsoever' does not add anything to the normal rules of causation.

##### **Activity 9.7**

**Return to Chapter 4 of this module guide and remind yourself of the principles governing causation. In particular, you must remember how not all 'but for' causes of a harm are the legal causes. Then answer the following question.**

**Jaz and Deepak attack Ali when he calls them names at a football match. Jaz hits the first blow which causes Ali to fall down. Jaz then loses interest and returns to watching the game. Meanwhile Deepak kicks Ali several times, causing him to suffer a ruptured spleen. Has Ali's (serious) injury been caused by both Jaz and Deepak or only by Deepak?**

##### *Mens rea***: s.18**

Section 18 is a crime of ulterior intent. What makes it so serious is that, accompanying the wounding or the causing of grievous bodily harm, is an intention matching or **exceeding** the simple causing of the injury that is to cause GBH or resist or prevent an arrest.

##### **Activity 9.8**

**Read Wilson, Section 11.4.C.2 '***Mens rea***', Section (b) 'Maliciously' and then answer the following question.**

**Is D guilty of the s.18 offence in the following two illustrations?**

- **a. P, a police officer, is chasing D for the purpose of arresting her. While crossing a road, P grabs hold of D. D pushes P away, causing P to fall over. He is hit and seriously injured by a passing car.**
- **b. As above, except that D does not push P, who trips over before being hit by the car.**

##### **Intending grievous bodily harm**

Whether the conduct element relied upon is a wound or GBH the prosecution must also prove that the defendant intended to cause the victim GBH, or, if that cannot be proved, the alternative intention of resisting or preventing an arrest. In other words, if D wounds V but not seriously the prosecution will fail on a s.18 charge unless they can prove that it was D's intention to cause a serious wound, that is a wound amounting to GBH. In the case of D causing V GBH in some other way, the prosecution must prove that this level of injury was intended. The jury should not normally be given a Woollin direction, but should simply be asked to consider whether, on the basis of all the evidence, D not only intended to do what they did but specifically intended to cause V really serious injury, etc. (see *Belfon* [1976] 1 WLR 741, *Purcell* (1986) 83 Cr App R 45).

A jury which is not convinced that D had the necessary intention to cause grievous bodily harm can bring in the alternative verdict under s.20 (malicious infliction of GBH) (*Mandair* [1994] 2 All ER 715). In *Banton* [2007] EWCA Crim 1847, the trial judge refused to allow the jury this option on a charge of s.18, when D had smashed a bottle in V's face. He told the jury that this could only mean one thing, namely that D intended grievous bodily harm. Do you agree?

**page 119**
##### Activity 9.9**

- **a. Read Wilson, Sections 6.6.B 'Intention in the criminal law: intention, purpose and motive' and 6.6.C 'The meaning of intention in the criminal law'. Then create an examination-style question in which a** *Woollin* **direction would be necessary in a case of causing GBH with intent.**
- **b. Read Wilson, Section 11.4 'Crimes of violence' and answer the following questions.**
  - **i. Identify two similarities and two differences between s.18 and s.20.**
  - **ii. Identify two similarities and two differences between s.20 and s.47.**

### **9.3 Consent and offences against the person**

We have already seen that absence of the victim's consent is one of the elements of common assault. This means that if D is charged with battery and the prosecution proves that D intentionally punched V in the stomach, and nothing more, the defence can make a submission of 'no case to answer'. This is because an essential element in the offence of common assault has been left unproven, namely that the force applied to V's body was not consented to.

This explains the decision in *Slingsby*, in which D was charged with manslaughter when his partner died of septicaemia following consensual, although extremely vigorous, sexual activity. The validity of the conviction depended upon whether the sexual activity involved an unlawful battery. The prosecution argued that it was because it was extremely rough and had caused the victim harm. This argument was rejected on the basis that the activity was consensual. Since there was no battery, there could be no liability for constructive (unlawful act) manslaughter.

Different principles apply where D causes harm deliberately. The deliberate causing of physical injury is considered inherently unlawful and, being inherently unlawful, victim's consent cannot make it lawful (*Donovan* (1931)). Before exploring this aspect of consent, let us examine the actual concept of consent.

#### **What is consent?**

This is not an easy question to answer since there is vast range of responses possible between, at one end of the consent spectrum 'Oh yes, please!' and the other 'Not over my dead body!' Clearly, if V submits to physical contact only due to force or the threat of force, this is not consent. However, the use of force or threat of force is not the only way consent can be vitiated. For example, deception or threats of financial or social harm or other non-violent threats might invalidate consent. In *Olugboja* [1982] QB 320, a rape case, the Court of Appeal drew a distinction between reluctant acquiescence (consent) and mere submission (not consent).

Whether consent is present or not is a question of fact for the jury on the basis of its own common sense and experience of life. In *Kirk* [2008] EWCA Crim 434, the Court of Appeal upheld a conviction for rape of a destitute and hungry girl who submitted to intercourse so as to be able to buy food. This was decided under the definition of consent provided by s.74 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, but the basic principles should be comparable. This was interpreted as a case of submission (I had no real choice) rather than reluctant acquiescence.

Consent may be express or implied. Obvious examples of implied consent occur in cases of everyday physical contact between people who know each other. Punching a friend in jest will usually be treated as impliedly consented to. As we shall see below, participants in sports are also deemed to consent to the ordinary 'rough and tumble' involved in the relevant sport, even where such rough and tumble falls outside the rules of the game.

**page 120**
#### consent must be effective
Apparent consent can be rendered ineffective in a number of ways. In particular, the consent of those who do not understand exactly what they are consenting to – for example, the young or those who lack mental capacity – may be ineffective. For this reason a tattooist was guilty of common assault for tattooing youths of 12 and 13, consent notwithstanding (*Burrell* v *Harmer* [1967] Crim LR 169).

More generally, certain types of fraud may vitiate consent. Consent is not vitiated simply because a person would not have agreed to the contact had they known all the relevant facts. It is vitiated only if the nature of the fraud prevented the victim from understanding what they were consenting to.

Since 2003, the position on consent in relation to sexual assaults, including rape, is regulated by the Sexual Offences Act 2003. It enacts that two deceptions vitiate consent, namely deception as to identity and deception as to the nature and purpose of the act. The pre-2003 Act law is still authoritative in relation to non-sexual assaults which is essentially similar. In *Bolduc* v *Bird* [1967] SCR 677, D asked V's consent to conduct a medical examination on her in the presence of his 'medical student', who in fact was not his medical student but a friend. It was held that her consent was not vitiated and there was no assault. A similar decision was reached in *Richardson* [1999] QB 444, in which V submitted to dental treatment by a dentist who had been struck off. It was held that V's consent was not vitiated by the fact that her choice was not fully informed. In both cases the deception was as to the quality of the contact rather than its nature, and to status rather than identity. Compare *Melin* [2019] EWCA Crim 557 where the appellant claimed falsely to be medically qualified before administering Botox injections. The Court of Appeal ruled that such a misrepresentation could vitiate consent if the fact of being medically qualified was a condition of the complainant giving consent. If so, the deception would go to the question of the appellant's **identity** and the legal validity of their consent.

#### **Activity 9.10**

**If Richardson had never been a qualified dentist, but was a charlatan, would this have vitiated V's consent?**

A comparable conclusion was reached in *Tabassum* [2000] 2 Cr App R 328, in which the defendant induced women to submit to breast examinations by misrepresenting his medical qualifications. The Court of Appeal held that such mistakes could vitiate consent since the victims were consenting to one thing (medical examination) and were getting another (indecent assault).

Judges are increasingly requiring consent to be fully informed for it to be operative. This is certainly the case in relation to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. In *Dica* (2004) and *Konzani* [2005] EWCA Crim 706, the Court of Appeal ruled that consent to the act of intercourse is vitiated for the purpose of common assault, ss.47 and 20 OAPA 1861, if – unknown to V but known to D – D is suffering from a sexually transmitted disease. **Please note** that consent to the act of intercourse for the purpose of the **crime of rape** is not vitiated in this case, since the act of intercourse was what the victims consented to and was what took place.

#### **Consent and violence**

The final limitation on consent must now be elaborated upon. This is that, although (absence of) consent is an essential element in common assault, it is not an essential element in crimes of violence such as ss.47, 20 and 18 OAPA 1861. This means, in effect, that the victim's consent is not normally a defence to a crime of violence. So consent is a defence to a kiss, a tap, a tickle or a slap, but it is not a defence to a private physical fight to settle an argument (as occurred in *A-G's Reference (No 6 of 1980)* [1981] QB 715). In this case Lord Lane CJ said:

It is not in the public interest that people should try to cause, or should cause, each other actual bodily harm **for no good reason**. Minor struggles are another matter.

**page 121**
In reaching this decision, the Court of Appeal approved the case of *Donovan* [1934] 2 KB 498. The appellant was charged with indecent and common assault upon a girl whom he had beaten with a cane, with her consent, for his own sexual gratification. Explaining his decision, Swift J said at 507:

If an act is unlawful in the sense of being in itself a criminal act, it is plain that it cannot be rendered lawful because the person to whose detriment it is done consents to it. No person can license another to commit a crime...As a general rule, although it is a rule to which there are well established exceptions, it is an unlawful act to beat another person with such a degree of violence that the infliction of bodily harm is a probable consequence, and when such an act is proved, consent is immaterial.

#### **Illustration 9.3**

- **a. Alan has an informal boxing match with his friend, Brenda. In the course of the match Alan and Brenda land several blows to the body. These do not result in any significant harm.**
- **b. Stephen and Richard have an informal boxing match. In the course of the match Stephen and Richard land several blows to the body and the face. Stephen suffers a broken nose and cuts and bruises as a result.**

In the first case, if Alan and/or Brenda were prosecuted for common assault, they would have an absolute defence, namely consent.

In the second case, if Richard were prosecuted for assault occasioning actually bodily harm, he would have no defence. Consent is not a defence to informal fighting causing actual bodily harm.

Note that if Richard were charged, as he could be, only with common assault he would have a defence as per the first case since common assault, unlike assault occasioning actually bodily harm, requires proof that V did not consent.

Let us examine more closely the claim that consent is ineffective where physical injury has been sustained. It is more accurate to say that, in the case of deliberately inflicted harm, consent will be ineffective unless the activity from which the harm derives is privileged as being in the public interest. In the case where the harm is not deliberately inflicted, consent will usually be effective because of the presumption that people should be free to take risks of physical harm.

#### **Deliberate infliction of harm**

*A-G's Reference (No 6 of 1980)* is authority, in effect, for the proposition that where injury is inflicted deliberately it cannot be consented to, unless the context within which the injury is inflicted is specially privileged on public interest grounds. Causing injury for sexual gratification is not deemed to be in the public interest. In *Brown* [1994] 1 AC 212, a case involving a consensual homosexual orgy in which quite serious injuries involving the genitals were deliberately inflicted, Lord Templeman for the House of Lords put it:

In my view the line properly falls to be drawn between assault at common law and the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm created by s.47 of the 1861 Act, with the result that consent of the victim is no answer to anyone charged with the latter offence or with a contravention of s.20 unless the circumstances fall within one of the well-known exceptions such as organised sporting contests and games, parental chastisement or reasonable surgery.

In *Emmett*, The Times, 15 October 1999, consent was similarly not available where a heterosexual couple engaged in consensual sado-masochistic activities of a particularly dangerous nature designed to enhance sexual pleasure, including the burning of the woman's chest with lighter fuel and partial suffocation.

No decision has yet been made on the legality of sado-masochistic activity involving a low level of violence, for example biting and scratching. In principle, *Brown* and *Emmett* notwithstanding, this should be treated as lawful. Although such activities cannot be presented as being in the public interest, it can certainly be argued that it would be contrary to the public interest to proscribe them, if only on grounds of

**page 122**
privacy and the principle of minimal criminalisation (see *R* v *Wilson*, below). Biting and scratching is a not uncommon incident of sexual relations even among those who would disapprove of the practice of sado-masochism. As we have already seen, victim's consent does render vigorous sex lawful even if it is of a nature to cause physical injury.

#### **Activity 9.11**

**Read Wilson, Sections 2.2.B.2 'Liberal objections to the enforcement of morality' and 2.2.B.3 'Is there a meaningful difference between legislating to enforce morality and legislating to prevent harm?' On the basis of the arguments presented there do you agree with their Lordships' decision in Brown?**

**No feedback provided.**

#### **Exceptions**

##### **Surgery, tattooing and body alteration**

Other exceptions to the rule that deliberately inflicted harm cannot be consented to include, as Lord Templeman remarks, 'reasonable surgery'. The implication behind the use of the word 'reasonable' is not clear, but probably does not require the surgery to be clinically necessary but, rather, reasonable according to the ethical standards informing surgery at the relevant time. Sex change operations and cosmetic surgery are therefore capable of being consented to, subject always to the requirement that the consent is informed. In the case of minors, the consent of both parents is necessary for non-clinically necessary procedures such as circumcision (*Re J (Prohibited steps order: circumcision*) [2000] 1 FLR 571.

Tattooing, ear piercing and other forms of body piercing and body alteration may also be consented to if reasonable (*Brown*). In *Wilson* [1997] QB 47, the Court of Appeal ruled that it was not unlawful for a man to brand his partner on the buttocks with a hot knife when it was consensual and done for purposes of adornment rather than simply to cause injury. The Court said that the criminal law should be slow to interfere with what people do in private. This does not affect the decisions in *Brown* and *Emmett*. The rather fragile distinction to be drawn between these cases and *Wilson* is that in the latter the consensual hurt suffered by V was incidental rather than the point of the exercise. The Court drew an analogy between this case and a case of tattooing, which is also lawful where consented to. Compare also the recent case of *R* v *BM* [2018] EWCA Crim 560. The Court of Appeal ruled that consent would not render lawful the removal by a tattoo artist of a customer's ear, of another customer's a nipple or the division of a tongue into two to produce an effect similar to a snake. There was no possible public benefit attached to such a procedure and, involving gratuitous mutilation, the procedure was too far removed from tattooing and piercing to sustain the argument that to criminalise would be an unreasonable interference with personal liberty.

##### **Activity 9.12**

**Read Wilson, Section 11.5.A.3 'What can be consented to?'. On the basis of what you read there do you agree with the decision in** *R* **v** *BM***? Do you think a similar approach should be taken in relation to full facial tattoos?**

**No feedback provided.**

##### **Boxing, wrestling and martial arts**

Boxing is a genuine exception to the rule that consent is ineffective in the case of deliberately inflicted injuries. It attracts a special privilege in that even acts intended to cause serious injury can be consented to. This is a peculiar exception, given that informal fighting attracts no such privilege and that the only positive public interest benefit discernible is the enjoyment spectators receive in watching the spectacle – hardly a 'good reason', one would suppose, for permitting it. It certainly sits ill with the position with respect to consensual sado-masochism where the participants themselves experience the enjoyment.

**page 123**
Wrestling and martial arts are probably not an exception because these sports, unlike boxing, do not have the intentional infliction of injury as the point of the activity.

Consent to incidental injuries is probably effective for the same reason as other contact sports, as will now be discussed.

#### **Non-deliberate infliction of harm**

##### **Games and sports**

The other privileged activities referred to by Lord Templeman include lawful sports and games. Consent is effective in relation to this category for a different reason than that for boxing – namely that the taking of risks and engaging in dangerous pursuits is normal human activity and should be criminalised only if the risk-taking is contrary to public policy. Injuries inflicted in the course of contact sports such as football and rugby will therefore be *prima facie* lawful unless deliberately inflicted, in which case consent, even were it to be present, is ineffective.

This is the conclusion to be drawn from *Barnes* [2004] EWCA Crim 3246 where the Court of Appeal said that resort to the criminal courts in cases of sporting injury should be exceptional. Most sports have their own codes of discipline which can properly be deployed in the face of dangerous play. An instinctive error, reaction or misjudgement in the heat of a game was not to be treated any differently. However, intentionally caused injuries give no immunity:

In making a judgment as to whether conduct is criminal or not, it has to be borne in mind that, in highly competitive sports, conduct outside the rules can be expected to occur in the heat of the moment, and even if the conduct justifies not only being penalised but also a warning or even a sending off, it still may not reach the threshold level required for it to be criminal. That level is an objective one and does not depend upon the views of individual players. The type of the sport, the level at which it is played, the nature of the act, the degree of force used, the extent of the risk of injury, the state of mind of the defendant are all likely to be relevant in determining whether the defendant's actions go beyond the threshold.

(*Per* Lord Woolf CJ at [15])

In principle, the same reasoning applies to wrestling and martial arts. Although potentially dangerous, participants are deemed to validly consent to injuries sustained as a result of contacts, whether or not they are explicitly covered by the rules of the sport, so long as they are of a nature to be expected of the sport as it is played at the relevant level.

##### **Horseplay**

The decision in the *A-G's Reference (No 6 of 1980)* case must be distinguished from cases of rough and undisciplined horseplay. The essence of the former was that the blows landed by the accused were intended to cause injury. Play fighting and other expressions of high spirits which result in physical injury are not so treated and consent may therefore be a defence. In *Jones* (1986) 83 Cr App R 375, D (a schoolboy) and others, to celebrate V's birthday subjected V to the 'bumps' (a procedure involving throwing the subject into the air and allowing them to drop on the ground). This caused V to suffer a broken arm and a ruptured spleen. D's appeal against a conviction under s.47 was allowed. Given the context there was evidence of either express or implied consent to the 'bumps' procedure. In any event even if consent were absent such that the *actus reus* was established, the defendants' belief that V was a willing participant meant that they lacked the *mens rea* for the crime charged.

##### **Sexual relations**

Consent, express or implied, is effective in relation to harms committed during sexual activity, so long as these are not deliberately inflicted for their own sake (see *Brown*, above). In *Slingsby* (1995), D inserted his hand into V's vagina and rectum with her consent. A ring which he was wearing caused internal cuts, and V later died of septicaemia. In the subsequent trial for manslaughter, D was held not to have committed an assault and so could not be liable for manslaughter.

**page 124**
In cases involving the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, informed consent will be effective to prevent liability under s.47 or s.20. Authority for this is *Konzani* (2005), in which the Court of Appeal made clear that so long as the transmittee of the disease knew of the disease at the time of intercourse, she consented both to the intercourse and to the risk of transmission of the disease.

##### **Activity 9.13**

**Read Wilson, Section 11.5.A.3 'What can be consented to?' and answer the following questions.**

- **b. Is it possible to reconcile the decision in** *Konzani* **with that in** *Emmett* **and** *Brown***?**
- **c. Read the case of** *Aitken* **(1992). Do you think this case was rightly decided?**
- **d. The Law Commission published a consultation paper entitled** *Consent and Offences against the Person* **in 1994. In it the suggestion is made that individuals should have the right to consent to any non-serious injury. Do you agree with this?**
- **e. Do you think consent should be a defence to harm caused while boxing, where the purpose of the competition is to cause harm, possibly life-threatening harm, to the other?**
- **f. Can the exception in the case of boxing be reconciled with the absence of an exception in the case of sado-masochistic sexual relations between consenting adults? If not, should they both be criminal or neither?**
