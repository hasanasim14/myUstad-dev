# Non fatal offences

What can be consented to? 
Professor William Wilson

## Learning objectives

At the end of this lecture you should be able

- To distinguish between common assault, where absence of consent is an element in the *actusreus* of both assault and battery, and crimes resulting in physical harm, where it is not.
- To understand that, although not an element in the *actusreus*, victim's consent may constitute a **defence** for crimes where the victim suffers physical injury.
- To remember, for later use, the circumstances when victim's consent may be a defence to a crime of violence and when it will not.
- To understand the policy and questions of morality which dictate when victim's consent either is or is not a defence for such crimes.
- To evaluate whether these questions of policy and morality are cogent and whether the resulting law is sufficiently clear.

## Consent to non fatal offences
Consent is an unqualified defence to common assault which comprises the separate offences of assault and battery. This is because the definition of common assault requires lack of consent as an element in the *actusreus.* So a person who punches their friend playfully is not guilty of battery because it is presumed or implied that this was consented to by the friend.

Compare *Collins v Willcock (1984)*

In most cases where consent is at issue, consent is not expressly given but is nevertheless implied. This is why contacts in the course of sporting events or sexual intimacy do not amount to battery.

*It was put this way in Collins v Wilcock (1984)*

"implied consent exists where there is jostling in crowded places, handshakes, back slapping, tapping to gain attention provided no more force was used than is reasonably necessary in the circumstances. There was no consent given for the grabbing of the arm."

## Consent

- So what does consent consist of? This may be important in cases where the fact of consent is disputed by the parties. Most of the case law in this area involve cases of rape or other sexual assaults but the law is essentially the same for all non fatal offences against the person.
- In *Olugboja* (1982), a case on rape, Dunn LJ ruled that there is a difference between consenting to physical contact, albeit reluctantly, and simply submitting to it. Submission occurs where a dominant party overwhelms the submissive party's freedom of choice.

### consent myst be effective
In three circumstances apparent consent is ineffective:

- 1. Lack of mental capacity
- 2. Uninformed consent
- 3. Consent induced by fraud
- 4. There are restrictions on the availability of consent where the act consented to involves the infliction of physical harm

### Restrictions on the availability of consent where physical harm is caused: What can be consented to?

- We saw in Slide 2 that consent is automatically a defence to common assault, sexual assault and rape. Indeed it is only the absence of consent which constitute these as crimes.
- The position changes when we examine the more serious offences against the person. Victim's consent is not a defence to murder, nor to duelling or maiming.
- Beyond these obvious cases there is no general defence of consent operating to excuse the infliction of physical harm. A key case is A-G's Reference (no 6 of 1980) (1981)
- 'It (is) not in the public interest that people should try to cause or should cause each other actual bodily harm for no good reason. Minor struggles are another matter' Lord Lane CJ:

### What can be consented to?

The principle which emerges from this case is that consent is not a defence to activities **intended** to cause harm unless the activities form a special public interest exception. This public interest exception applies in the following situations

- Surgery (including cosmetic surgery)
- Tattooing (*Burrell v Harmer*)
- Piercing and similar forms of body alteration (*R v Wilson*),
- Boxing and comparable martial arts.

The exception is not unqualified. See for example *R v BM* (2018.

### consent must be effective
 **Violence in the Course of sexual activity**

In both *Donovan*(1934) and *Brown* (1993)

- It was held that sado-masochism could not fall within a public interest exception.
- Their conclusion is that intentionally causing another person actual bodily harm or worse was inherently unlawful and, like murder and fist fights, the consent of the victim would not make it lawful - even where this was done for the sexual gratification of the parties. See also *R v Emmett* (1999).

 **Unintentional but Foreseen Harm**

There are three prime cases where a person causes harm unintentionally but where the harm is nevertheless foreseen. These are:

- 1. Horseplay
- 2. Sports
- 3. Sexual Relations

#### 1. Horseplay

Causing injury in the course of play fighting or other forms of horseplay is lawful consented to - *Jones (1987)*

#### 2. Sports**,** *Barnes (2004)*
- In making a judgment as to whether conduct is criminal or not, it has to be borne in mind that, in highly competitive sports, conduct outside the rules can be expected to occur in the heat of the moment, and even if the conduct justifies not only being penalised but also a warning or even a sending off, it still may not reach the threshold level required for it to be criminal. That level is an objective one and does not depend upon the views of individual players. The type of the sport, the level at which it is played, the nature of the act, the degree of force used, the extent of the risk of injury, the state of mind of the defendant are all likely to be relevant in determining whether the defendant's actions go beyond the threshold. (Per Lord Woolf CJ)

#### 3. Rough Sex

Perhaps the most uncertain aspect of the rules on consent concerns what might be termed as rough or dangerous sex.

This is because, as stated in Slingsby and confirmed in Konzani and Wilson, the *Brown* principle does not apply where the harm caused is incidental to a 'legitimate sex act' and is **not** performed for the purpose of causing harm. So biting in the course of intercourse, violent intercourse, and unintentionally transmitting an STD, if they cause the participants harm, is not unlawful if consented to. *Slingsby (1992} , Konzani (2005), Wilson (1996)*

### Reform of Consent

- The Law Commission has proposed that:
- Consent should be a defence to actual bodily harm but not to grievous bodily harm.
- See Wilson 11.4.A.4 for discussion.
