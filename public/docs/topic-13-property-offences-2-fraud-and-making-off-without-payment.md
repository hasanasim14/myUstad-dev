Core text
• Wilson and Lammasniemi, Chapter 15 'Fraud and making off without payment'.

## Introduction

This topic deals with the offences enacted by the Fraud Act 2006, which includes fraud by false representation, fraud by failure to disclose information and obtaining services dishonestly. It also deals with the offence of making off without payment, enacted by s.3 Theft Act 1978. These offences criminalise various ways of dishonestly gaining a financial advantage or causing a financial loss.

## Mini lecture 1 - FRAUD

Prof William Wilson, Criminal law

Fraud and similar offenses. This mini lecture covers the offenses fraud, obtaining services by deception, and making off without payment. This mini-lecture concentrates on fraud, but for examination purposes, they're all equally important.

The Fraud Act tells us that fraud can be committed in three ways. By false representation, by failure to disclose information, and by abuse of position. We will cover only the first two. Section two defines fraud by false representation. It states, a person is in breach of this section if he, A, dishonesty makes a false representation, and B, intends, by making the representation, one, to make a gain for himself or another, or to cause loss to another, or to expose another to a risk of loss.

As with theft, you should always have the statute to hand in analyzing a fraud problem. It makes your analysis secure.

Making a false representation. A false representation means simply pretending that something is the case when it is not. This can be done expressly in a statement, impliedly, or by conduct. For example, the defendant can pretend to be rich by saying so, by driving an expensive car, by wearing certain kinds of clothes, or by giving their address as being in a rich part of town. If this is done in order to deceive another person into partying with their property, the defendant commits fraud.

The Act defines false in an unusually broad way. It includes statements which are misleading as well as untrue. Notice in subsection 2b that a person does not have to know the representation is untrue or misleading so long as he knows it might be.

Let's see what this means in practice. Here is a case study. Adam goes into Rustbucket Cars and asks to see some low mileage secondhand cars. One attracts him particularly, and he asks Eve, the salesperson, "How many miles does this car do to the gallon?" "60", says Eve, although she knows it only does 60 for motorway driving, and it does only 35 miles per hour under average conditions.

In this case, though Eve says no more than can be expected of the salesperson in her position, she has committed the actus reus of fraud. She has made a statement which is misleading, and she knows it. It's a half-truth. This means the statement she makes is false for the purpose of section two. Whether she's guilty of fraud depends upon her mens rea.

A person does not commit fraud by staying silent about some key piece of information. Say, for example, if A sells B a painting knowing that B thinks it's valuable, whereas A knows it's not, he's not guilty of fraud for this failure to disclose. He is only guilty of fraud if he represented it to be valuable, which he has not. This is subject to two exception. First, where there has been a change of circumstances, and second, where there is a legal duty of disclosure.

The first exception is where the circumstances giving rise to a representation change so that the original statement no longer accurately describes the true state of affairs.

Look at this case study. Adam, a car salesman, truthfully tells Eve that a particular car is the latest model. On the strength of that representation, Eve agrees to buy the car. By the time Eve comes to collect and pay for the car, a new model becomes available. Adam fails to tell Eve this and she buys the car.

In this illustration, Adam commits fraud by not telling Eve of the new model. This is because his original representation is still, in fact, being made and it is now false. The second exception to the rule that a person does not commit fraud by staying silent is when Section 3 applies. It applies if the defendant dishonesty fails to disclose information to another person, which he is under a legal duty to disclose.

Look at this case study. Adam belongs to a golf club which permits members to invite guests upon payment by the member of a fee. He invites Eve, a non-member, to play. He decides dishonestly not to inform the golf club and does not pay the fee. In our case study, Adam is under a legal obligation to tell the golf club that Eve is not a member as this is part of his contract. He is, therefore, guilty of fraud.

This means that in a problem question involving failure to provide information with a view to making a gain, you must ask yourself the question, was the defendant under a legal duty to disclose the information? If you decide they are under the duty, you must explain how it arises. Is it a contract term, for example?

To be guilty of fraud, a false representation must be made dishonestly. The Ivey definition of dishonesty applies, and it must be made with the purpose of making a gain or causing a loss. The Act defines gain or loss in financial term as extending only to gain or loss in money or other property. So a person who deceives another into having sex with him is not guilty of fraud as his intention, though dishonest, is not to make a financial gain.

That is the end of this outline mini-lecture on fraud.

## 13.1 Fraud overview

The Fraud Act 2006 abolishes all the deception offences in the Theft Acts 1968 and 1978. These included the offences of obtaining property by deception, obtaining services by deception and evading a debt by deception. The main reason for the change was that the previous offences had a high degree of overlap, were unduly technical, and did not cover some important forms of fraudulent wrongdoing. For example, communicating false information by computer as a 'phishing' ploy designed to defraud the recipient could not ground a deception offence, because all deception offences required D to have made a false representation which was believed and acted on by a specific person.

This causal effect had to be proved by the prosecution. Similarly, a car seller who made false representations to a purchaser who subsequently bought the car would not be quilty of fraud unless the prosecution could prove beyond reasonable doubt that, but for these representations, the purchase would not have been made. This clearly makes the prosecution's job difficult, and probably too difficult.

The Fraud Act 2006 replaces the deception offence with one basic fraud offence, which can be committed in three  $ways - by:$ 

- false representation
- failure to disclose information
- abuse of position.

The main change renders the wrongdoing the intentions of the wrongdoer rather than the reactions of the victim. David Ormerod (Smith and Hogan's criminal law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2019) [ISBN 9780198702313]) complains that, in effect, the new offence criminalises 'lying'. It is intended to capture wrongdoing such as that of computer 'phishers', who make their money out of duping the one in a million people who happen to believe them, which was not possible under the old law. The problem is that it also in theory captures many less heinous forms of behaviour which are part and parcel of everyday commercial life. Sellers are expected to tempt us with 'white lies', are they not? The maximum sentence for fraud is 10 years' imprisonment.

## 13.2 Fraud by false representation

The essence of this form of fraud is some form of deception. Section 2 of the Fraud Act 2006 reads as follows:

- $(1)$  A person is in breach of this section if he-
  - (a) dishonestly makes a false representation, and
  - (b) intends, by making the representation-
    - (i) to make a gain for himself or another, or
    - (ii) to cause loss to another or to expose another to a risk of loss.
- $(2)$  A representation is false if-
  - (a) it is untrue or misleading, and
  - (b) the person making it knows that it is, or might be, untrue or misleading.

(3) 'Representation' means any representation as to fact or law, including a representation as to the state of mind of-

- (a) the person making the representation, or
- (b) any other person.
- (4) A representation may be express or implied.

(5) For the purposes of this section a representation may be regarded as made if it (or anything implying it) is submitted in any form to any system or device designed to receive, convey or respond to communications (with or without human intervention).

### **Elements of the offence**

The actus reus requires proof that D made a false representation. The mens rea requires proof that D:

- knew the representation was or might be false, and
- acted intending to make a gain or cause a loss, and
- acted dishonestly.

### 13.2.1 Actus reus: fraud

The conduct element in fraud by false representation is simple. It requires proof that D made a representation and that representation was false. There is no need to prove that V acted to their detriment in reliance on the representation. Indeed, there is no need for it to be communicated to V so long as it is made. Therefore, the phisher commits the offence as soon as they type out their false statement: the prosecution does not have to wait until the email is transmitted.

#### **Meaning of representation**

Representation is not defined in the Fraud Act 2006 except to say:

- (3) 'Representation' means any representation as to fact or law, including a representation as to the state of mind of-
  - (a) the person making the representation, or
  - (b) any other person.
- (4) A representation may be express or implied.

The simplest meaning of representation is 'stating something', 'pretending something', 'professing something' or 'creating an impression'. So a seller who tells a buyer that the car he is selling is in good condition makes a 'representation' that it is in good condition. Similarly, a buyer who tells the seller that her credit is good makes a 'representation' that her credit is good. A representation can be made without words; it can be made by conduct for example, painting over rust damage on a car, thus giving the impression that the vehicle is in better condition than it is. It can also be implied.

#### **Illustration 1**

Assume A wishes to buy a car on credit and wishes to influence the decision to advance her credit. The following words or actions will be express representations.

- a. My credit is good (representation of fact).
- b. I bank with Coutts and Co. (a bank used largely by the rich and powerful) (one express and one implied representation of fact – the implied representation is creating an impression that she is rich and powerful).
- c. I have just won £1 million on the lottery (representation of fact  $-$  she is creating an impression that she is rich).

d. I will pay you back next week (representation as to state of mind – she is creating an impression that she intends to pay the money back).

#### **Study task 1**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 15.1.C.1. 'Fraud by false representation', Section (a) 'Actus reus'. Look at the following scenarios and state what representations are being made and identify which, if any, are false.

- a. A, a poor man, wanting to impress his new girl friend, hires a Rolls Royce for the day and takes her for a ride.
- b. A, a car dealer, turns back the odometer reading on a car prior to selling it.
- c. A pays for gambling chips in a casino with a cheque, having lost the bank's authority to use it.

Show feedback

- a. A is impliedly representing that he is rich. This is false. He is also representing that he is entitled to be driving the car. This is true. He is not impliedly representing that he owns the car because even rich people hire Rolls Royces.
- b. A is representing that the car has done the mileage that it now says on the odometer. This is false.
- c. A is representing, impliedly, that he is the account holder. This is true. He is also representing, impliedly, that the cheque will be honoured. Whether this is true or not depends upon whether he uses a cheque guarantee card which guarantees payment of the amount on the cheque. If he does and it does then the statement is true. Otherwise it is false. He is also representing, impliedly, that he has the bank's authority. This is false.

Note, for exam purposes, the most important abilities you should be able to display in the context of fraud are:

- 1. being able to identify the representation that you think is the basis of the fraud charge, and
- 2. being able to explain why in relation to that representation it is false.

It will usually help to ask yourself 'What false impression or statement is D making for the purpose of defrauding  $V$ ?'

Can one make a representation by saying or doing nothing?

As a general rule, the answer is no, since making a representation means to state something or do something.

#### **Illustration 2**

 A sells B a car, the odometer of which he knows carries a false reading.

A cannot be guilty of fraud as he has made no false representation as to the mileage. It would be different if, upon being asked, A confirmed the reading or said that it was genuine (express representation of fact) or that he believed it to be genuine (express representation as to his state of mind).

#### **Study task 2**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 15.1.C.1.(a) 'Actus reus' and answer the following questions.

- a. A is selling her car. It is in bad condition. To ensure that B, a potential buyer, does not realise this, she tells B she will only show him the car at 9pm. B inspects the car and does not spot the defects. Is A guilty of fraud?
- b. Would it make any difference to the answer to the above question if A had said, untruthfully, 'You will have to come at 9pm as I do not get back from work until then'?

Show feedback

- a. No. No untrue representation has been made. The car is as it is.
- b. Yes. A is guilty of fraud. She has made a false representation ('I do not get back from work until 9pm') with a view to making the sale.

In two situations, silence may constitute a false representation. In both cases, the silence creates a false impression.

Where there exists a duty of disclosure (also covered by s.3)

#### **Illustration 3**

Adam performs a surgical operation on Eve at Green Wing Hospital. He does not tell the hospital that Eve is a private patient and, as a result, the hospital, assuming Eve is a national health service (free) patient, does not invoice him for the cost of the operation (Firth (1990) 91 Cr App R 217).

By not telling the hospital, when he is under a duty of disclosure, Adam is creating a false impression that Eve is a national health service (NHS) patient rather than the private patient she actually is. Because of his duty of disclosure, the hospital is entitled to assume that all patients operated on are NHS patients unless Adam tells them otherwise.

Where the circumstances giving rise to a representation change, so that the original representation no longer accurately describes the true state of affairs

#### **Illustration 4**

- a. Adam tells Eve truthfully that the odometer reading on the car he is selling is accurate. Prior to concluding the sale, he discovers that the odometer has, in fact, been tampered with. He does not communicate this to Eve.
- b. Adam truthfully tells his local authority that Eve, his mother, is bedridden and so in need of a downstairs bathroom. On the strength of this representation, the local authority agrees to install a new bathroom. Before the work is started, Eve dies. Adam fails to tell the local authority of her death (the facts of Rai [2000] 1 Cr App R 242).

In both cases, Adam's silence is impliedly telling the other party that nothing relevant to their agreement has changed since the first representation was made. Put another way, in both cases, the statement that Adam has made which was once true is now false. The change in circumstances has made it so.

#### **Representations and machines**

Under the old law of the Theft Acts, it was also not possible to make a representation to a machine: the essence of the deception offences was the tricking of a human mind. The Fraud Act 2006 s.2(5) now makes it possible to commit fraud via a machine, since a representation is regarded as having been made:

if it (or anything implying it) is submitted in any form to any system or device designed to receive, convey or respond to communications (with or without human intervention).

This would include putting false information in an online tax or insurance form, or computer 'phishing', as in the case of those who place viral sob stories on the internet which are intended to cause naïve recipients to transfer money to the phisher. In this latter case, the representation is made as soon as the representation is typed on to the phisher's machine, thus relieving the prosecution from having to prove that anyone read it.

A person who puts a foreign coin in a slot machine, such as a car park ticket machine or chocolate machine, also commits fraud, whether or not the ruse is successful, not because of subs.2(5) but because, by inserting the coin, they are making a representation in the usual way. 'This is a £1 coin', 'this is a \$2 coin', as the case may be. Under the old law, this was not a fraud, because it required a human mind to be deceived. As has been explained, the fraud is now complete upon the making of a false representation. It does not have to be effective or even communicated.

#### **Study task 3**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 15.1.C.1.(a) 'Actus reus' and answer the following question.

Adam, intending to sell his car, puts an advertisement on the windscreen while it is in his garage. It says that the car has been driven by one careful female owner. In fact it has been driven by him. Has Adam committed the actus reus of fraud at this stage?

 Show feedback

Yes. The *actus reus* of the offence is made out upon the representation being 'made'. There is no requirement that it is communicated to an intending purchaser.

#### The representation must be false

By subs. 2(2) of the Fraud Act 2006, a representation is false if (a) it is untrue or misleading, and (b) the person making it knows that it is, or might be, untrue or misleading. This is a very inclusive definition. It includes the situation of someone who believes what they say to be true but knows it might not be true or knows it might be misleading. The ambit of the act is so wide it covers the kind of cases of (sharp) practice in which most tradespersons have traditionally engaged to make a living. It criminalises 'mere puffs'. If Heineken describes its lager as 'probably the best lager in the world', is it acting fraudulently when all purchasers understand that the claim is not to be taken too seriously and do not buy their lager on the strength of it?

#### **Study task 4**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 15.1.C.1 (a) 'Actus reus' and answer the following questions. Remember what was said earlier about the importance of being able to identify the representation and what is false about it.

- a. Adam owns a BMW in which he has driven 111,000 miles since he bought it a year ago. The odometer, having 'gone round the clock', shows 11,000 miles. It is worth £15,000 as it stands, but £30,000 if the mileage truly was 11,000. He puts a notice on his car windscreen in the following terms: 'BMW for sale. One year old. One careful owner. £30,000'. Has Adam made a false representation? If so, what is it?
- b. Claire is an art dealer. She describes a painting in the sales particulars as an 'early Constable'. The painting, as she knows, is painted not by John Constable, but by his son, John Charles Constable, a lesser artist. Has Claire made a false representation? If so, what is it?
- c. Jane is an art dealer. She describes a painting in the sales particulars as an 'early Rembrandt'. She believes it to be a Rembrandt, and indeed bought it as such, but knows that in the case of this particular painter precise attribution is difficult due to the number of workshop versions of Rembrandt's work on the market. In fact it is not a Rembrandt. Has Jane made a false representation? If so, what is it?

Show feedback

- a. Yes. This is a false representation because, by pricing the car at £30,000, his notice is 'misleading' and he knows it. He is misleading the purchaser into thinking the car is worth £30,000.
- b. Yes. Although the statement is true it is misleading and Claire knows it to be so.
- c. Yes, because the statement is untrue and Jane knows that it might be untrue.

### 13.2.2 Mens rea: fraud

The core mens rea element for fraud, contrary to ss.2, 3 and 4 of the Fraud Act 2006, is the defendant's intention, by making the representation, to make a gain for themself or another, or to cause loss to another or to expose another to a risk of loss. Intention in this context, in line with its meaning in theft and unlike its meaning elsewhere, means purpose or knowledge of virtual certainty. In theft, such knowledge is intention as a matter of law, rather than as a matter of evidence (see Section 5.3.2 'Murder and manslaughter: what does "intention" mean?'). If D knows that their representation will cause loss to V or expose V to the risk of loss, D intends that consequence. Gain and loss are defined by  $s.5(2)$  and (3) of the act:

- $(2)$  'Gain' and 'loss' -
  - (a) extend only to gain or loss in money or other property;
  - (b) include any such gain or loss whether temporary or permanent;

and 'property' means any property whether real or personal (including things in action and other intangible property).

(3) Gain' includes a gain by keeping what one has, as well as a gain by getting what one does not have.

#### **Study task 5**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 15.1.C.1 'Fraud by false representation', Section (b) 'Mens rea' and decide, giving reasons, whether the following representations are capable of resulting in a conviction of fraud.

- a. Adam promises to marry Eve in order to encourage her to agree to sexual intercourse.
- b. Adam tells people in a queue for a concert that he has a bad back in order to gain a better place in the queue.
- c. Eve misrepresents her golf handicap in order to be permitted to join a top club.

Show feedback

- a. No.
- b. No.
- c. No.

In each case the gain intended is not one of money or property.

Note: The gain or loss can be temporary or permanent, so making a misrepresentation to induce a loan of a car or money, or to gain time to pay a debt, would be covered. In this latter example, fraud is constituted, since 'gain' includes a gain by keeping what one has, as well as a gain by getting what one does not have. 'Loss' includes a loss by not getting what one might get, as well as a loss by parting with what one has.

There are four possible cases of this mens rea requirement.

- 1. The intention to make a gain for oneself by false representation (this will be the most usual case).
- 2. The intention to make a gain for someone else: for example, giving a false reference to secure someone a job or a loan.
- 3. The intention to cause a loss to another. Usually this will go hand-in-hand with an intention to make a gain, either for oneself or for another, but it will include cases where the representor's purpose is purely destructive. Here is an example.

#### **Illustration 5**

Janice, a committed vegetarian, places an advertisement in the Daily Globe newspaper implying that the hotdogs of HotdiggetyDog hotdog manufacturers actually contain dog meat. The representation, which is false, is made in an attempt to damage sales of HotdiggetyDog meat products.

This is fraud, because of Janice's intention to cause financial damage to HotdiggetyDog.

4. The intention not to cause a loss to the representee but to expose them to the risk of loss (this is more unusual).

#### **Illustration 6**

- a. A, a mortgage broker, puts false earnings particulars on clients' mortgage forms to induce the lender to lend to her clients.
- b. B, a financial adviser, advises his client, C, to invest a large amount of money in X company, telling him it is a good investment. He knows that the investment is risky but hopes that the investment pays off and will advance his reputation as an adviser.

A is quilty of fraud. Her liability turns on the fact that, although she does not intend to cause the lender any loss, she does intend to expose the lender to the risk of loss, namely the risk that the borrowers may default (Allsop (1977) 64 Cr App R 29). B is also guilty of fraud for the same reason.

#### **Dishonesty**

The final mens rea element is dishonesty. Dishonesty, in this context, is Ivey dishonesty. There is no equivalent to s.2 of the Theft Act 1968 in the Fraud Act 2006. This means that a person who makes a false representation in order to gain what they believe they are in law entitled to is not automatically to be acquitted: it will be a matter for the jury. This was made clear in the pre-2006 Act case of Woolven (1983) 77 Cr App R 231 and one must assume the position is unaltered.

## 13.3 Fraud by failing to disclose information

### 13.3.1 Actus reus: failing to disclose information

This provision is probably unnecessary, since a failure to disclose information which one has a duty to disclose counts as a representation for the purpose of s.2 of the Fraud Act 2006. Section 3 was included in order to simplify the proof of guilt. Section 3 allows a conviction simply upon proof of the duty to disclose and the failure to do so with the relevant intent. The important aspect of s.3 is the requirement that the defendant be under a legal duty of disclosure: a moral duty is not enough. The concept of 'legal duty' is explained in the Law Commission's Report on Fraud, which said:

Such a duty may derive from statute (such as the provisions governing company prospectuses), from the fact that the transaction in question is one of the utmost good faith (such as a contract of insurance), from the express or implied terms of a contract, from the custom of a particular trade or market, or from the existence of a fiduciary relationship between the parties (such as that of agent and principal).

So, an art dealer would not commit the offence if they bought a painting at a car boot sale knowing that the painting was worth a thousand times the asking price, as they have only a moral duty of disclosure.

13.3.2 Mens rea: failing to disclose information

The mens rea for s.3 of the Fraud Act is the same as for s.2. There is no requirement that the defendant be aware that they are under a legal duty of disclosure, although evidence of lack of awareness will, no doubt, influence the jury's assessment of dishonesty.

#### Section 3 states:

 $(1)$  A person is in breach of this section if he  $-$ 

(a) dishonestly fails to disclose to another person information which he is under a legal duty to disclose, and

(b) intends, by failing to disclose the information-

(i) to make a gain for himself or another, or

(ii) to cause loss to another or to expose another to a risk of loss.

The mens rea for s.4 is the same as for s.2. There is no requirement that the defendant be aware that they are under a duty to safeguard the other's financial interests, although evidence of lack of awareness will, no doubt, influence the jury's assessment of dishonesty.

Note: Students, when answering problem questions, often ignore s.2 and go straight to s.3. This is bad practice and illustrates the importance of identifying the (false) representation. You should generally only use s.3 as a default option - that is, where, having concluded that s.2 is not available and stated your reasons why, you go on to consider the alternative possibility of liability under s.3. All of the examples given in the illustrations and the Study Tasks in this section are, first and foremost, cases of fraud by false representation (s.2). Consider, for example, Study Tasks 1-5. A student who fails to analyse each of these activities by reference to s.2, and who simply talks about whether Adam, Clare and Jane are under a duty of disclosure and so liable under s.3 for not making disclosure, misses the whole point of these questions and would not do very well!

## 13.4 Fraud by abuse of position

Section 3 of the Fraud Act states:

(1) A person is in breach of this section if he  $-$ 

(a) occupies a position in which he is expected to safeguard, or not to act against, the financial interests of another person,

(b) dishonestly abuses that position, and

(c) intends, by means of the abuse of that position  $-$ 

(i) to make a gain for himself or another, or

(ii) to cause loss to another or to expose another to a risk of loss.

(2) A person may be regarded as having abused his position even though his conduct consisted of an omission rather than an act.

The Law Commission described the type of relationships intended to be covered by fraud by abuse of position as follows:

The necessary relationship will be present between trustee and beneficiary, director and company, professional person and client, agent and principal, employee and employer, or between partners. It may arise otherwise, for example within a family, or in the context of voluntary work, or in any context where the parties are not at arm's length. In nearly all cases where it arises, it will be recognised by the civil law as importing fiduciary duties, and any relationship that is so recognised will suffice. We see no reason, however, why the existence of such duties should be essential. (para. 7.3)

Whether a person occupies a position in which they are expected to safeguard the interests of another is a question of law for the judge. Usually, this will be because the relationship, as in the case of trustee/beneficiary, contains, or is constituted by, explicit duties of acting in the other's interests or not acting against those interests. It may, however, simply be understood, as where A permits B to use her apartment while she is on holiday. It goes without saying that B would abuse his licence if he were to use A's apartment to deal in drugs or from which to sell weapons.

## 13.5 Obtaining services dishonestly

Section 11 of the Fraud Act 2006 replaces s.2 of the Theft Act 1978. It covers any case where services, for which payment would be expected, are obtained as a result of dishonest conduct. By s.11:

(1) A person is quilty of an offence under this section if he obtains services for himself or another—

- (a) by a dishonest act, and
- (b) in breach of subsection (2).

The new offence differs from the old one by constituting the conduct element as any form of dishonest conduct rather than the deception required by s.2.

### 13.5.1 Actus reus: obtaining services dishonestly

Under the previous law, it was an offence only where services were obtained as a result of a deception. Now any dishonest act will be covered. The difference in coverage can be seen in the following example.

#### **Illustration 7**

D parks her car in a pay-and-display car park. She does not pay for a ticket, hoping that she will return before a ticket inspector arrives.

Under the Theft Act 1978, this would not be an offence under s.2, as no false representation has been made. It is, however, an offence under s.11 because D has obtained a service and her conduct is dishonest.

#### **Illustration 8**

 Other cases of obtaining services dishonestly include the following:

- a. entering a cinema without paying
- b. having a haircut without paying
- c. obtaining chargeable data or software (e.g. music downloads) over the internet without paying
- d. ordering a meal in a restaurant knowing you have no means to pay (also fraud by false representation)
- e. attaching a decoder to a TV to access chargeable satellite services without paying
- f. using the services of a members' club without paying and/or without being a member.

Section 11 also differs from ss.2, 3 and 4 of the Fraud Act 2006 in the *actus reus* requirement that the service be actually obtained. In this respect it is similar to the offence it replaced. However, where the relevant services are obtained as a result of a false representation, rather than by some other form of dishonest act, it will be possible to proceed under either section.

#### **Illustration 9**

a. Adam parks his car in a pay and display car park. Eve, who is about to leave the car park, gives Adam her unexpired ticket. Adam places the ticket on his windscreen.

Adam is guilty under s.11. He is also guilty of fraud by false representation. By putting the ticket on his windscreen, he is impliedly representing that he has paid for it. The gain he makes is keeping the fee due.

b. Mary untruthfully tells the sales assistant in a cinema that she is underage so as to be allowed in at a lower price.

Since Mary is not a minor, she is guilty of fraud by false representation. The gain she intends to make is the money she is enabled to keep in her pocket by her false representation as to her age. She is also guilty of obtaining services dishonestly.

#### What conduct does 'obtaining services' cover?

Subsection 11(2) clarifies what is meant by 'obtaining services'. As with the previous offence, it refers to a narrower range of conduct than you might think.

(2) A person obtains services in breach of this subsection if-

(a) they are made available on the basis that payment has been, is being or will be made for or in respect of them,

(b) he obtains them without any payment having been made for or in respect of them or without payment having been made in full, and

(c) when he obtains them, he knows-

(i) that they are being made available on the basis described in paragraph (a), or

(ii) that they might be, but intends that payment will not be made, or will not be made in full.

Subsection 11(2) makes it clear that only services made available on the basis that payment has been, is being or will be made for or in respect of them are covered.

#### **Illustration 10**

Adam asks Eve, his next door neighbour, to cut his lawn for him telling her, untruthfully, that he has hurt his back. She does so. Adam is not guilty of fraud by false representation because he has not made a financial gain or caused a financial loss. He is also not guilty of obtaining services dishonestly because, although he was dishonest, the services he obtained were not made available on the basis that payment has been, is being or will be made for or in respect of them.

### 13.5.2 Mens rea: obtaining services dishonestly

The offence requires Ivey dishonesty, knowledge that payment is required or might be, and an intention not to pay for the service or not to pay in full. Section 2 of the Theft Act 1968 does not apply.

## 13.6 Making off without payment

Section 3 of the Theft Act 1978, which is still in force, provides:

(1) Subject to subsection (3) below, a person who, knowing that payment on the spot for any goods supplied or service done is required or expected from him, dishonestly makes off without having paid as required or expected and with intent to avoid payment of the amount due shall be guilty of an offence.

(2) For purposes of this section 'payment on the spot' includes payment at the time of collecting goods on which work has been done or in respect of which service has been provided.

(3) Subsection (1) above shall not apply where the supply of the goods or the doing of the service is contrary to law, or where the service done is such that payment is not legally enforceable.

This offence is designed to enable a prosecution where, although the defendant has acted dishonestly, it may be difficult to prove or prevent fraud or theft. It is easier to prove that a driver has dishonestly made off without paying for their petrol than to prove that they had an intention not to pay when first filling up the car – which would ground a charge of theft or fraud.

### **Study task 6**

At examination time you should be wary of putting undue emphasis on this offence in cases where theft, fraud or obtaining services dishonestly are also present. This offence is best thought of as an offence of last resort, for use where proving another offence may be difficult. For example, read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 15.2.A 'Actus reus' and answer the following question.

While out shopping, Yuri sees a shirt priced £50. He swaps the price tag for one marked £30 and pays the lower price. Yuri buys a DVD and pays for it with a £10 note. The shop assistant mistakenly gives him change for a £20 note. Yuri realises this once he is outside the shop but keeps the money. What offences, if any, have been committed?

In this question most of the marks would be awarded for discussion of theft and fraud in relation to the swapping of the price tags. Can you see why it is a case of both fraud and theft? Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Sections 15.2.A 'Actus reus' and 15.1.C 'Fraud'. In relation to the mistake question your discussion should

again concentrate on theft. Only then consider whether there is a making off (see Wilson and Lammasniemi, Sections 15.3.A.1 'Making off' and 15.3.A.3 'Without having paid as required or expected'). Has Yuri made off without paying as required or expected in the light of the mistake made?

### 13.6.1 Actus reus: making off without payment

A person can be liable only if they have made off from the spot where payment was due. Liability turns therefore on whether payment is due and, if so, where that spot is and whether D has departed from it. In McDavitt [1981] Crim LR 843, D, following an argument about his bill, made for the restaurant door having refused to pay for his meal. He was stopped and the police were called. D admitted having intended to leave without paying. A submission of no case to answer was accepted on a charge of making off without payment. The Court of Appeal ruled that 'making off' means making off from the spot where payment is required or expected. In this case the spot was the restaurant. The jury should have been directed that it could not convict of this offence but it was open to them to convict of an attempt.

Compare Moberly v Alsop [1992] COD 190, in which D travelled on a train without paying for a ticket. She was apprehended, having gone through the ticket barrier, and charged with making off without paying. She argued that she had not made off without paying because the spot for paying was the ticket office and she had not made off from there. Indeed, she had never been there! This argument was rejected.

A person commits the offence only if, when making off, payment on the spot is required or expected. If, therefore, the expectation is that D will be 'billed' for the goods or services they are not guilty, even if it was their intention when making off that they would not pay. Similarly, D will not commit the offence if there has been a breach of contract or if the contract was otherwise unenforceable. It was stated in R v Wilkinson [2018] EWCA Crim 2154 that a taxi fare cannot be lawfully due unless and until the driver has taken the passenger to the requested destination, or to the point where the passenger asks to be let out of the taxi, thereby varying the destination. As a result, the offence was not committed where, following a dispute between a passenger and driver, the driver told the passenger that, if she was going to complain, she could get out of the taxi immediately at a point short of her destination, which offer she refused.

Making off takes no particular form. A person can make off by stealth, or brazenly without any form of dissimulation. A question does, however, surround the status of permitted departures, as when a customer dupes a creditor into allowing them to depart by pretending to have left their wallet at home. Is this a making off? In Vincent [2001] EWCA Crim 295, the Court of Appeal concluded that it was not, since the effect of the deception is to pre-empt any expectation that payment would be made on the spot. Fraud could have been charged, but only if it could be proved that D had at some stage decided not to pay before receiving any goods or services. Under these circumstances, D would in this case, by staying on in the hotel, have been impliedly representing that he intended to pay for the goods or services when he did not (DPP v Ray [1974] AC 370).

### 13.6.2 Mens rea: making off without payment

The mens rea for s.3 of the Fraud Act 2006 is dishonesty and an intention to avoid payment of the amount due. Significantly, s.3 does not state that the intention must be to make permanent default. The commonsense view is this should not be the case because having to prove D intended to make permanent default will make the prosecution's burden of proof rather difficult. It is easy to claim that one intended to pay later and difficult to disprove this beyond reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, in Allen [1985] AC 1029, the House of Lords held that the offence was constituted only upon proof of an intention permanently to avoid paying the amount due. So a hotel customer who checked out without paying did not commit the offence if he was temporarily financially embarrassed and intended to pay later.

## Learning activity 1

This activity is designed to help you to remember some of the cases in this area. Match the statements below to most relevant case.

1. D impliedly represented that he intended to pay for the goods or services when he stayed sitting in a restaurant after he decided not pay for his meal.

2. Sets a new test for dishonesty that requires the jury to consider what was the defendant's actual state of knowledge or belief as to the facts; and if his conduct is dishonest by the standards of ordinary decent people.

3. D escaped through an exit barrier after being caught travelling without a valid ticket. She argued that she had not made off without p because she did not make off from the ticket office where tickets were purchased. Court held she was rightly convicted as there are mo than one spot where payment is due.

4. D turned up and took the written part of a driving test impersonating someone else, having been paid to do so.

5. A defendant, who was not a student, went into a shop wearing an academic gown worn by members of Oxford University and purch items at a discounted student price as the shopkeeper assumed he was a student. In the circumstances, wearing the outfit amounted t false representation.
