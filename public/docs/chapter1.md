### Introduction

This module guide is designed to help you to learn, understand, apply and evaluate those aspects of the criminal law which form the syllabus of the University of London Criminal law module. It is intended to be read in conjunction with your textbook and has been designed to fit together with it. In each chapter of the module guide you will be directed to parts of the textbook, the virtual learning environment (VLE) or cases to be found in the Online Library, with a view to answering questions about the subject. In this way your knowledge and understanding of the subject is enhanced. Reading without thinking cannot achieve this.

### 1.1 The lawyer's method

Students new to law often think that being a lawyer is all about knowing a lot of law and 'learning the cases'. Strangely, this is not true. The most law you will ever know will probably be around examination time when you have committed a lot of material to memory. As you move from student to practising lawyer, much of this law will be forgotten. But you will have an understanding of the basic principles of each of the subjects you have studied, and you will have internalised the skills and competencies which are so valuable to lawyers' clients.

Proficiency in criminal law involves a number of different skills and competencies, including:

- a knowledge of the rules and principles governing criminal offences
- an ability to use books, libraries and the internet to discover these rules
- a basic understanding of the rules of evidence and procedure
- an ability to identify the rule(s) applicable to a fact situation and to apply them logically and coherently.

Attaining these latter competencies is necessary to discharge effectively the day-today tasks of a criminal lawyer – whether student, solicitor, advocate or judge. However, true mastery requires something further. It requires also a critical and evaluative attitude. The criminal law in action is not just a matter of doctrine. The purpose of criminal law doctrine is the delivery of criminal justice and criminal justice is a contingent outcome in which rule, process and context all play their part.

Understanding criminal law requires, therefore, an appreciation of the day-to-day workings of the criminal justice system. Moreover, it requires an understanding of the resources of the criminal law to produce substantive justice. The criminal law is not just a set of rules. It is underpinned by ethical and political principles designed to ensure both justice to the individual and protection to the community the individual inhabits. If the mechanical application of a given rule to a fact situation acquits a dangerous or wicked person, or convicts someone neither dangerous nor blameworthy according to ordinary standards, something has gone wrong. Students should therefore be prepared to subject the rules to critical scrutiny. Lawyers do this all the time, not least in court when their job is to fight their client's cause. Sometimes, they will be saying, in effect, 'This is bad law and should not be followed' or 'This law was not intended to cover this situation', and so on.

Throughout this module guide we shall be posing the question 'Do you agree with this decision?' Take these questions seriously! Here is an example.

In a leading case called *Ireland,* which we will be looking at in Chapter 9*,* a man made a woman's life a misery by making a succession of telephone calls, usually silent ones. Eventually she had a breakdown, suffering clinical depression. Obviously this man had done something very wrong but the criminal law has no authority to punish him unless the thing he has done is a **criminal offence** (the principle of legality). Is it? What offence had he committed? Ireland was charged and convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. This requires proof of an assault, which means acts causing the victim to fear immediate personal violence. Did those calls cause the victim to fear **immediate violence**? It requires proof of actual bodily harm. Is depression 'bodily' harm? The House of Lords upheld his conviction. If I were to ask you now 'Do you agree with this decision?' you might say something like this. 'Well the decision is right from the point of morality – what he did was unforgiveable – but it is possibly not right from the point of view of the principle of legality (that people should not be punished unless their action is prohibited by the criminal law). He had not assaulted her. He had frightened her but that is not the same thing. And he had not caused her actual bodily harm. Depression is mental harm not bodily harm.' This is the kind of critical thinking which you should be deploying.

### 1.2 What does criminal law comprise?

Crimes are distinguished from other acts or omissions which may give rise to legal proceedings by the prospect of punishment. It is this prospect which separates the criminal law from the law of contract and tort and other aspects of the civil law. The formal threshold at which the criminal law intervenes is when the conduct in question has a sufficiently serious social impact to justify the state, rather than (in the case of breach of contract or trespass) the individual affected, taking on the case of the injured party.

The American Model Penal Code provides a good restatement of the proper purposes of the criminal law, namely:

- 1. to forbid and prevent conduct that unjustifiably and inexcusably inflicts or threatens substantial harm to individual or public interests
- 2. to subject to public control persons whose conduct indicates that they are disposed to commit crimes
- 3. to safeguard conduct that is without fault from condemnation as criminal
- 4. to give fair warning of the nature of the conduct declared to be an offence
- 5. to differentiate on reasonable grounds between serious and minor offences.

Which of these propositions were contradicted in *Ireland*?

### 1.3 Procedure

The criminal law's purposes are discharged by law enforcement and the machinery of criminal justice generally. Law enforcement includes preventing crime, typically by policing and also by bringing offenders to justice. The procedures vary according to the nature of the offence committed. Criminal offences are classified according to whether they are arrestable or non-arrestable. The former, which includes more serious crimes, allows a suspect to be arrested without an arrest warrant.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has the overall responsibility for bringing proceedings. It is their job to assess the weight of evidence, and decide, in the light of the evidence and the public interest, whether a prosecution should proceed. Discretion, as much as the rules of criminal law, is influential. So, for example, the CPS had the job of deciding whether to proceed in the case of *Ireland*. It would have been a difficult decision to make.

It should be understood that, although official charging standards govern the exercise of the CPS's discretion over which offence to charge, there is no necessary connection between the offence actually committed and that charged. Thus a person who has committed robbery may be charged only with theft; a person who has committed a wounding may be charged only with assault; a person who has committed murder may be charged only with manslaughter. Undercharging carries a number of benefits. First, it may have evidential advantages. It is easier to prove theft than robbery. Second, it may encourage a guilty plea. Third, it may enable the case to be heard summarily rather than on indictment. The advantage for the prosecution of summary trial is that it is less costly and more efficient. It is also thought to increase the chances of conviction.

Offences are triable:

1. summarily that is, before magistrates
2. on indictment that is, in Crown Court before a judge and jury
3. either way that is, either summarily or on indictment.

All defendants have a right to jury trial in respect of offences triable either way. In practice, the vast majority of offences are heard by magistrates. Whether heard summarily or on indictment, the conduct of the trial in each case is dictated to a greater or lesser extent by the rules of evidence and procedure.

**page 15**
The formal accusation made against a defendant is in the form of an indictment or, where the matter is tried summarily before magistrates, an information. This contains a statement of the offence and particulars of the offence charged. Thus the indictment in the case of *Ireland* would have been in the following form.

John Ireland is charged as follows:

**Statement of Offence**: assault occasioning actual bodily harm

**Particulars**: John Ireland, between the dates of September 1998 and May 2004, assaulted Vicky Henderson, causing her actual bodily harm.

Judge and jury have separate roles in the conduct of the trial. The judge takes care of the law. In *Ireland*, for example, counsel for defence queried whether causing someone psychiatric injury was covered by the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The trial judge ruled that it was. As a result, Ireland pleaded guilty and so the jury were not called upon to give a verdict. When the judge gives such a ruling on a matter of law it is always open to the defence to appeal the ruling. Appeals are made from Crown Court to the Court of Appeal (and then the Supreme Court). This is what the defence did in *Ireland*, unsuccessfully as it turned out.

The jury are the judges of fact. This means that it is for them ultimately to decide how much weight to ascribe to the various pieces of evidence adduced by prosecution and defence. They will not do this unsupervised. In the course of the trial, the judge will ensure that no evidence is taken into account which is either irrelevant to the proof of guilt of the defendant or, if relevant, less probative than prejudicial. After the prosecution and then the defence have presented their cases, the judge will sum up and will review the facts for the jury. The judge will then explain to the jury what the law is and the facts they have to find to sustain a conviction. The judge will also tell the jury that the burden of proof is at all times on the prosecution and that the standard of proof is 'beyond reasonable doubt'. These instructions to the jury are known as jury directions. If the judge makes a mistake in directing the jury this can be appealed on the ground of misdirection.

### 1.4 The sources of criminal law

The criminal law is a creature of the common law, that is, judge-made law. Some of the most important crimes have their source in the common law. Murder and manslaughter are obvious examples. However, the majority of criminal offences are now statute based. Such offences may either have originated in statute or are common law offences whose elements have been incorporated into statute, such as theft and most crimes of violence. In the latter case, such statutes will not always define the full common law offence. This will leave the common law with a significant role still to fulfil. In *Ireland*, for example, the offence charged was a statutory offence but the full scope of the offence is a matter of judicial decision.

European law and the European Convention on Human Rights are other key sources of criminal law. It is important in particular to understand the Convention and its impact. Rarely a month goes past without some aspect of domestic law being challenged for being inconsistent with the Convention. Prime examples in the criminal field include *Dudgeon* v *UK*, in which the court held that a legislative provision criminalising homosexual activity between consenting adults in private in Northern Ireland was a breach of Article 8. And in *A* v *UK* the court ruled that a common law defence of reasonable chastisement which had led to the acquittal of a man who had beaten his step-child with a garden cane did not provide adequate protection for the latter's Article 3 rights. In both cases Parliament acted quickly to eradicate the inconsistency.

The consequences of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union will have no immediate effect but in time it appears likely that questions of compatibility will no longer be demanded.

### 1.5 Study materials

The core textbook for this subject is:

¢ **Wilson, W.** *Criminal law***. (Harlow: Pearson, 2020) seventh edition [ISBN 9781292286747].**

Throughout this guide, this textbook will be referred to as 'Wilson'. Usually, section references will be given to direct your reading. For example: Wilson, Section 11.4. 'Crimes of violence'.

You will find guidance as to which sections of the textbook you should read for any particular topic. This textbook is essential for examination success. This module guide has been specifically designed to dovetail with it, through the activities which appear in each chapter, so that the extra pieces of information and understanding which you will require to pass your examinations will be easily available. Reading the module guide alone will not be enough. You will see why if you look at last year's *Examiners' report* (available on the VLE)!

You are also advised to read a criminal law casebook of your choice. The following ties in most closely with the textbook:

¢ **Dine, J., J. Gobert and W. Wilson** *Cases and materials on criminal law***. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010) sixth edition [ISBN 9780199541980].** 

There are a number of others on the market which are equally useful.

You are encouraged to read widely and you will find it useful to refer to other textbooks on occasion. Here are some of the most useful for **Criminal law**.

- **Ormerod, D. and K. Laird** *Smith, Hogan and Omerod's criminal law***. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018) 15th edition [ISBN 9780198807094].**
- **Horder, J***. Ashworth's principles of criminal law***. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2019) ninth edition [ISBN 9780198777663].**
- **Kyd, S, T. Elliott and M.A. Walters** *Clarkson and Keating: criminal law: texts and materials***. (London: Sweet & Maxwell, 2020) 10th edition [ISBN 9780414075559].**
- **Herring, J.** *Criminal law: text, cases and materials***. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2020) ninth edition [ISBN 9780198848479].**
- **Herring, J.** *Great debates in criminal law.* **(Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2020) fourth edition [ISBN 9781352010237]. You will find this book both helpful and enjoyable for that part of the module and examination which requires you to analyse and evaluate areas of criminal doctrine.**

Please ensure that you use the latest edition of any textbook or casebook you choose. You will also need an up-to-date criminal law statute book. You will be able to take an unannotated copy into the examination.

### 1.6 Online resources

In addition to the hard copy materials, there are numerous online resources to help you with your studies. You can access these through the VLE. The Online Library contains everything you would find in a well-stocked law library and you should use it regularly, particularly for the purpose of reading key cases. Such reading gives valuable understanding about how lawyers reason their way through to conclusions and often contains little nuggets of information and understanding which you can deploy to good purpose in your essays.

**Criminal law** has its own section of the VLE which contains lots of important materials, including the complete module guide and feedback to activities, computer-marked assessments, newsletters, recent developments, updates, links to the Online Library and other useful websites, a discussion board, past examination papers and *Examiners' reports*.

**page 17**
There is also a full set of criminal law presentations on the VLE, including audio lectures and accompanying slides. These presentations introduce you to each topic covered on the syllabus and in the module guide and dovetail with both. A good way of learning is, therefore, to listen to the lecture and then turn to the matching part of the module guide. It can also usefully be referred to as a consolidation and revision aid.

### 1.7 Preparing for the examination

At the end of the module you will need to pass the examination in order to progress. The module guide and its activities, the textbook and audio presentations have been designed to ensure that you will have covered everything necessary for success, and in sufficient detail. Please ensure you approach your studies systematically, chapter by chapter, working through **all** the questions and activities, and making reference to the textbook and other materials as you do so. The feedback to activities in this guide is available on the VLE. Doing the activities properly is crucial. This enables you to develop the legal skills which full time students get from the small group tutorial classes when doing their law degree at the University. Reading and remembering is not enough. You are being examined on your skills as a lawyer! At the end of each chapter, ensure you have tackled all the 'Am I ready to move on?' questions which have been posed.

Advice and guidance on how to answer essay and problem questions appears at intervals in the module guide. More information about the examination will be made available on the VLE along with more sample examination questions. You must ensure that you are up to date with the format of the examination and any changes from previous years which will be detailed on the VLE.

## **1.8 Getting started**

If you are new to law, you may find the subject a bit daunting at first, particularly if you come from a non-English jurisdiction. But, in time, you will find it is just like any other academic subject. Criminal law is full of interesting cases and ideas and we hope that as you read through the module guide and textbook you begin to find it enjoyable as well as interesting. When you get to that stage you will know you are well on track for success.

Good luck!
