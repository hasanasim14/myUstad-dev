## Mini lecture 1 -  RAPE: THE BASIC ELEMENTS

This mini-lecture deals with the basic elements of rape following the enactment of the Sexual Offences Act of 2003. It does not cover questions of consent, which will be covered in another mini-lecture.

Prior to 2003, the crime of rape was not fit for purpose. The prosecution had to prove an absence of consent on the part of the victim, and secondly, that the accused knew that V was not consenting, or might not be consenting. This was a tough burden to discharge, which caused serious problems for victims in court. How do you prove, for example, that a defendant knew that V might not be consenting, when he, the defendant, claims she did? The rules of evidence at the time allowed the defence to interrogate the victim about her private life in intimate detail, for the purpose of casting doubt on her evidence. It made rape victims feel that they were the defendant in the dock, rather than their abuser. Little wonder that victims of rape were reluctant to report rapes and give evidence in court.

The changes in the law affected by the 2003 Act attempted to address these problems. First, the prosecution's burden of proving absence of consent is made easier. Second, the fault element now requires proof that the defendant's belief in consent was based on reasonable grounds. In other words, it's not enough for the defendant to say, "I honestly thought she was consenting." His belief has to be reasonable.

The 2003 Act makes it easier to establish the offence. First, consent has a statutory definition. Second, the fault is now objective. D's belief that V is consenting must be reasonable. The biggest change in the law is provided by sections 75 and 76. In certain circumstances, for example, sexual intercourse following administration of a date rape drug, the victim's consent is presumed absent, and the defendant is presumed to have known this. The effect of this is that the victim does not have to give evidence or suffer cross-examination by the defence.

Turn off recording and have a look at section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. This gives us the definition of rape. Section 1, subsection 1, gives us the Actus Reus and fault element, and subsection 2 renders it explicit that a man should take active steps to ascertain that his actions are consented to, or risk it being decided that any belief he may have had that the victim was consenting was not based on reasonable grounds.

Subsection 3 refers to the presumptions of consent. The Actus Reus elements of rape are threefold. Penetration by a man's penis of the vagina, mouth, or anus of the victim, and an absence of consent. The rules relating to consent are also applicable to sections 4 to 7, and so will be dealt with in another mini-lecture.

The definition of rape makes clear that the offence can still only be committed by a man. There must be penetration with the defendant's penis. A woman who pretends to be a man in order to have sexual intimacy, including penetrative sex with a woman, is therefore not guilty of this offense. Both men and transsexuals are within the protection and coverage of the 2003 Act. Notice that rape can involve the penetration of the victim's mouth as well as the vagina or anus, and by vagina, this includes surgically constructed vaginas as in the case of transsexuals.

Section 78 embodies the pre-2003 Act law by defining penetration as a continuing act from entry to withdrawal. This means that if a person consents to penetration but then changes his or her mind in the course of the act, then the defendant will be guilty of rape if he fails to withdraw.

The final element in the actus reis is that the victim does not consent to the penetration. Consent and how it is proven is the subject of the second mini-lecture.

We turn now to the Mens Rea of Rape. There are two elements to the Mens Rea. The first is the intention to penetrate the victim's vagina, anus or mouth. The second is the absence of reasonable belief in the victim's consent.

Let's look at these two Mens Rea elements in turn. First, the defendant must intend to penetrate the victim's vagina, anus, or mouth. This requirement that the prosecution prove that the defendant intended the act of penetration is not entirely theoretical. For example, it is possible that in the course of, say, advanced foreplay, a man may, without necessarily intending to, penetrate the other person with his penis. If this occurs, he is not guilty of rape because the penetration was not intentional.

Another possibility occurred in *Gabbai*. The defendant had penetrated the victim's vagina with her consent. Later, he penetrated the victim's anus without her consent. The judge told the jury that to be guilty of rape in these circumstances, the prosecution had to prove that this penetration was intentional and not accidental, as where, for one reason or another, such as intoxication, the defendant mistakenly thought he was penetrating the vagina.

The second element in the Mens Rea of Rape is the absence of reasonable belief in the victim's consent. This element was widely welcomed at the time. It is too easy to claim a belief that the victim consented and too difficult to disprove beyond reasonable doubt. Now the jury must convict the defendant, even though they accept that he honestly thought the victim to be consenting if they believe that this belief was not held on reasonable grounds. This issue came into question in *Ciccarelli*, where the victim, after a party, woke up to find the defendant having intercourse with her. She had spoken with the defendant during the party but had not given him any reason to think she was interested in having sex with him. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge was right in telling the jury there was no evidence to support his alleged belief that she would consent. In short, his belief, if he had one, was not based on reasonable grounds.

Where section 75 and section 76 apply, it is presumed that the defendant did not have reasonable grounds for believing the victim was consenting. This will be dealt with in the other mini-lecture.
## Introduction

The law of rape is contained in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (SOA 2003). This Act reordered and restructured all sexual offences, whose rationale and structure reflected their piecemeal development through the common law, the Sexual Offences Act 1956 and the later amendments thereto. The overall philosophy is to:

provide coherent and clear sex offences which protect individuals, especially the more vulnerable, from abuse and exploitation, enable abusers to be appropriately punished, and be fair and nondiscriminatory in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act 1998.

Part 1 of the SOA 2003 enacts the newly constituted structure of sexual offences, which includes rape, assault by penetration, sexual assault and causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent. It deals with the issue of consent and, in particular, seeks to simplify the process of establishing absence of consent by the use of presumptions. It also covers child sex offences, including those taking place within a family context. Part 2 is Jargely a re-enactment of the Sex Offenders Act 1997, containing measures for the protection of the public. In this topic, we will be examining just one sexual offence, namely rape.

## 8.1 Sexual Offences Act 2003, s.1 - rape

(1) A person (A) commits an offence if
  - he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with his penis, (a)
  - B does not consent to the penetration, and
  - A does not reasonably believe that B consents. 
(2) Whether a belief is reasonable is to be determined having regard to all the circumstances, including any steps A has taken to ascertain whether B consents.
(3)Sections 75 and 76 apply to an offence under this section. 
(4) A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for life.

### 8.1.1 Conduct elements

The actus reus of rape involves the non-consensual penetration of the mouth, anus or vagina of a man or a woman by a man's penis. Penetration by the penis is key to the actus reus of rape. Penetration of the vagina, anus or mouth with the tongue or finger or with objects such as broom handles, bottles or dildos is not rape. It is the separate offence of (sexual) assault by penetration (SOA 2003, s.2).

Under SOA 2003 s.79(2), 'Penetration is a continuing act from entry to withdrawal.' This enshrines the pre-SOA 2003 decision in Kaitamaki [1985] AC 147 that a man who continues to have intercourse after consent is withdrawn commits the *actus reus* of rape. Rape is an offence which can only be committed by a man, but, since the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, it can be committed on either a man or a woman. Any nonconsensual penetrative vaginal, oral and anal sex constitutes rape. Ejaculation is not necessary (R (on the application of F) v DPP [2013] EWHC 945 (Admin)). Under s.79(3), 'vagina' includes surgically constructed vaginas following gender reassignment surgery.

Rape has, since 1992, been possible between man and wife. Before this, the consent of the wife was presumed unless the marriage had terminated. Henceforth, the consent of the wife must be forthcoming and all the provisions of the SOA 2003 apply to determine whether it is.

## Mini lecture 2 - *Consent and sexual offences

The material covered in this lecture is to found in the study guide chapter eight and Wilson 12.7. The law relating to sexual offenses including rape was a major problem prior to the Sexual Offences Act of 2003. Foremost among these problems concern the proving of consent and the fourth element. How do you prove, for example, that a defendant knew that the complainant might not be consenting when he claimed she did? The rules of evidence of the time allow the defense to interrogate the complainant about her private life in intimate detail for the purpose of casting doubt on her evidence.

It made rape victims feel that they were the defendant in the dock rather than their abuser. The key changes affected are to be found in section one of the Sexual Offences Act of 2003. Take a look at these before we turn to the next slide. The 2003 Act makes it easier to establish the offense and protects the victim from unnecessarily obtrusive questioning. The act states that in certain circumstances, where session 75 or 76 applies, consent is presumed absent and fault is presumed to be present. In those circumstances, the prosecution do not have to prove this liability.

It is presumed where section 75 or 76 does not apply, prosecution still have a much easier job in establishing the fault element. First, rules of evidence restrict the kind of questioning the defense can ask the victim about her private life. Second, the fault element has changed from subjective to objective. This belief that V was consenting, must now be a reasonable one. It is no answer to the charge of rape that they honestly believe the complainant to be consenting if that belief was not formed for good reason. Whether it is or not is a matter for the jury and the jury make that decision based upon their own experience and common sense.

Most important changes are encapsulated in Section 76 and Section 75. Section 76 provides for two conclusive presumptions where if the facts are found as alleged, the defendant is found automatically guilty without the need for absence of consent and for fault to be proven. The presumption that there was no consent, the absence of reasonable belief on the defendant's part cannot be rebutted or challenged by the defense if section 76 applies.

Section 75 provides, by contrast, six evidential presumptions where if the facts are established as alleged, guilt is presumed unless the defendant can rebut the presumption by providing plausible evidence that despite these facts, the complainant did, in fact, consent or the accused did, in fact, have a reasonable belief that the complainant was consenting. The two key changes introduced by the 2003 act then are, first, a much more exacting fault element and second, a major change in the way absence of consent and fault are to be approved.

Take a look first Section 76. Section 76 is very important for the prosecution. If it proves these two circumstances beyond reasonable doubt in the mind of the jury, then it does not have to prove absence of consent on the part of the complainant nor disprove that the defendant reasonably believed in the existence of consent. They do not need, in other words, to go on to prove absence of consent or absence of reasonable belief. This is presumed conclusively if they are able to prove that either these two circumstances exists.

Because the consequences of the presumption are so serious for the defendant, the Court of Appeal said in Jheeta that any attempt by the prosecution to raise this presumption must be scrutinized rigorously. The case of Tabbassum is an example of subsection A and Elbekkay is an example of Subsection B. These are being dealt with in the lecture on consent to non-fatal offenses, and so will not be dealt with here, but what must be remembered is that if the prosecution can prove facts which support a finding that there was an intentional deception as to the nature or purpose of the Act has happened in Tabbassum or a case of impersonation has happened in Elbekkay, that is all the prosecution need to establish the defendant's guilt.

I've referred already to the case of Jheeta. I'm now going to look closely at this case. Not because it is a good illustration of Section 76 (2)(a), far from it, I should deal with it because it explains the procedure to be followed when a presumption is raised unsuccessfully. This is very important for your purposes. D had a sexual relationship with C. Whenever C try to end her relationship with D, he sent her text messages pretending they were from different police offices telling her it was her duty to sleep with him otherwise, should receive a fine. Charged with rape, the Court refused to allow the conclusive presumption.

The main purpose of the act the defendant performed with her was sexual intercourse. She was not deceived about this, she was deceived about the situation she was in. Section 76, (2)(a) had no application in such a case. The prosecution were clearly trying it all in trying to raise the presumption here. He had certainly deceived her but not in this way. Does this mean Jheeta was acquitted of rape? No, it doesn't. If the prosecution failed to convince the court that a presumption applies, as here, then the prosecution is back to square one.

It must prove the complainant did not consent and they must disprove the defendant's claim that his belief that she did consent was held on reasonable grounds. Whether she did consent or not is decided in accordance with section 74 which states that consent is present if she agrees by choice and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice. Clearly, the complainant in Jheeta did not have the freedom and capacity to choose whether to have sex with the defendant because of the threats which had been made.

Clearly also, Jheeta himself could not have entertained any reasonable belief that the complainant did truly consent, otherwise, the threats would not have been necessary. Jheetas's conviction for rape was upheld. Let's turn now to Section 75. This also eases the task of the prosecution in proving the elements of the offense in certain circumstances. Where these circumstances exists, a presumption arises that consent with absent and fault with present. However, these presumptions are not conclusive.

They can be rebutted by the defense giving plausible evidence that despite all, the complainant did, in fact, consent or that the defendant did reasonably believe that the complainant consented. If the presumption is rebutted, it's back to the prosecution to prove all the elements of the offense in the ordinary way, including lack of consent and lack of reasonable belief in consent. Let's turn now to Section 75. Section 75 (2) sets out the six sets of circumstances where it is presumed that the complainant did not consent and that they did not entertain a reasonable belief in that consent.

The first three are cases where the use of violence or threats of violence, either to the complainant or another, accompany the sexual act. Also, a presumption applies where the complainant was being unlawfully detained. If the evidence shows that the complainant was imprisoned, hit or threatened with violence at the time of the sexual act, it is presumed that she did not consent and that they knew it. The final three circumstances in Section 75 subsection (2) involves situations where the presence of consent would be surprising or difficult to come by, namely where the complainant was asleep or unconscious or the complainant was not able to communicate consent because of disability or the complainant was intoxicated as a result of having been given a stupefying substance.

If D has sex with the complainant while he or she is asleep it is presumed that he or she did not consent and D knew it. Similarly, if D adulterates the complainant's soft drink with alcohol or drugs before having sex with him or her, it is presumed that the complainant did not consent and D knew it. To reiterate, for the presumption to apply, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the circumstance existed.

For example that the complainant was asleep when D had intercourse with her. The complainant is then presumed not to have consented and D is presumed to have known that. These presumptions however unlike section 76, the defense has a right of rebuttal. To avoid conviction, the defendant must adduce plausible evidence that although the complainant was asleep, et cetera, she never the less consented or if she did not consent adducing, evidence showing his belief that she was consenting was reasonable.

Say for example the defense may give evidence that he and the victim were in a stable relationship, sleeping sex was a common occurrence or that they were both fetishists and sexual activity was routinely accompanied by violence, dominant behavior such as the use of hand cuts, all of that although in voluntarily intoxicated, the intoxication served only to release the victim's inhibitions, not to remove consent. The evidence needed to rebut the presumption does not have to be overwhelming but it must be plausible. If it is not, the judge will remove the evidence from the jury and the conviction will be affirmed.

A good illustration occurred in Ciccarrelli. After a party thrown by the defendant and attended by the complainant, the complainant became drunk and fell asleep in the defendant's spare room. She woke up to find the defendant on top of her and she told him to get off. The fact that the defendant knew that the complainant was asleep meant that there was a rebuttable presumption that she did not consent and that the defendant knew that. The defendant however, sort to rebut the presumption by claiming that although admittedly she did not consent, he reasonably believe she would as they had met each other before and had been talking together a lot during the party.

The judge ruled that this was not evidence that he had any reasonable grounds for thinking that she would consent to sex. The presumption was not rebutted. His appeal against conviction was unsuccessful. Let's now change the facts of Ciccarrelli to make his evidence more plausible. Look at the case study on this slide. The presumption applies clearly but here there's a possibility that D will succeed in rebutting the presumption. Although C clearly did not consent to what D did, D has got grounds for thinking she would. Whether they are reasonable grounds is a matter for the judge.

If the judge thinks there may be reasonable grounds, the presumption would be rebutted and the prosecution are back to square one and must prove all of the elements of the offence in the usual way. They must go to trial and prove the satisfaction of the jury, one, that C did not consent. This will not be difficult and two, that D did not have reasonable grounds for believing that C did consent. This would be more tricky. The decision is for the jury. Assuming you were on that jury, what is your verdict? The next few slides provide a summary of what we've learnt so far together with other material you must look at.

## 8.2 Absence of consent

In most cases of rape, the main problem for the prosecution is proving absence of consent. The problem has been described as linked with the 'infinite circumstances of human behaviour, usually taking place in private without independent evidence, and the consequent difficulties of proving this very serious offence' (Bree [2007] per Hallett J at [36]). Until the passing of the Act, the difficulty of proving lack of consent to a standard of beyond reasonable doubt created substantial problems for the victims of rape. These problems were compounded by inflexible and insensitive rules of procedure and evidence by which the victim, as the prime prosecution witness, was routinely forced to defend themselves against intrusive questioning designed to portray the victim as a woman of loose morals who was unlikely to have refused consent. This led to the charge that the criminal justice system did not take rape seriously and tended to prioritise the rights of the accused over those of the victim.

The SOA 2003 has sought to address that charge and to ease the burden of the prosecution by having a number of conclusive presumptions (s.76) and evidential presumptions (s.75). The effect of these is that, where these apply, there will rarely be any need for the victim to be cross-examined on the question of consent; it will be presumed absent. If neither s.75 nor s.76 applies, the prosecution is required to prove absence of consent in the usual way by reference to s.74. The prosecution will, therefore, be anxious to establish that a presumption does apply, if possible, since it will ease its burden considerably. As a student, you should follow the same procedure. First, consider whether a presumption applies and only if it does not consider whether s.74 is satisfied.

## 8.3 The presumptions

The SOA 2003 imposes two types of presumptions.

- 1. Conclusive presumptions, s.76. These cannot be rebutted.
- 2. Evidential presumptions, s.75. These can be rebutted by raising evidence that, notwithstanding the circumstance relied upon, the victim nevertheless did consent.

### 8.3.1 Conclusive presumptions

By s.76, it is conclusively presumed both that V did not consent and D did not reasonably believe V to consent in the following circumstances:

 $(2)...(a)$  the defendant intentionally deceived the complainant as to the nature or purpose of the relevant act;

(b) the defendant intentionally induced the complainant to consent to the relevant act by impersonating a person known personally to the complainant.

The job of the prosecution, therefore, is to try to establish beyond reasonable doubt either of these two circumstances. If it succeeds, the case is won without having to establish anything else.

#### Section  $76(2)(a)$ 

A pre-SOA 2003 example of the first presumption is Williams [1923] 1 KB 340. D, a singing teacher, told V, his pupil, that it was necessary to perform an act in order to improve her singing. She agreed, not knowing, or understanding, that the act she was engaging in was sexual intercourse. It was held that her consent was vitiated by fraud as to the nature and quality of the act. What V was consenting to and what she thought she was consenting to were completely different in their nature. Compare Linekar [1995] QB 250, where it was held not to be a deception as to the nature and quality of the act for a person to trick a prostitute into having intercourse without payment. What she agreed to (intercourse) is what she got. It is possible that this case might be decided differently under the SOA 2003, since V could plausibly argue that, although she consented to the nature of the act, she did not consent to its purpose. The purpose for her, after all, was financial, not sexual. However, in Jheeta [2007] EWCA Crim 1699, the Court of Appeal stated that, where this presumption is raised, it should be the subject of 'stringent scrutiny', since, if accepted, it is conclusive on the question of guilt.

#### **Study task 1**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 12.7.A.2 and the summary and explanation of Devonald.

Answer this question:

Is Devonald consistent with Linekar? If Linekar were decided today might it be decided any differently?

#### Section $76(2)(b)$

Before the SOA 2003, a man who induced a person to have sexual intercourse with him by impersonating their partner committed rape. So it was rape when the defendant, the twin brother of V's boyfriend, had intercourse with V by pretending to be the brother: Elbekkay [1994] EWCA Crim 1. The SOA 2003 extends the old rules on impersonation, in that consent is vitiated not only when it is the complainant's partner or spouse who is impersonated but also when it is any person 'known personally to the complainant'. No doubt there will be some interesting cases arising out of social-networking friendships concerned with establishing exactly what 'known personally to the defendant' means. The key point to remember is that the presumption only applies where the person impersonated is known personally to the complainant.

#### **Illustration 1**

D tells V he is Brad Potts, a famous film star, in order to secure her consent to sexual activity. He is not Brad Potts, although he looks a lot like him. V engages in sexual activity with him, believing him to be **Brad Potts.** 

This is not a case where the presumption applies because, although V believes D to be Brad Potts, her mistaken belief is not about the person she is having sex with but about his name and attributes. This is because Brad Potts is not known personally to her. This is not to say that V does consent to the activity but only that, if she does not consent, it is not by virtue of the conclusive presumption. To secure a conviction, the prosecution will need to establish that s.74 applies (i.e. that, given the deception, the activities engaged in were not 'freely chosen'). A big ask one would hazard.

#### Section 76: questions of procedure

The procedure, where there is an issue that consent may be vitiated by one of the circumstances in s.76, is that the prosecution will seek to establish the existence of that circumstance. If that fails, the prosecution will then seek to negate consent by relying on s.74. This is what occurred in *Jheeta* (2007). D began a sexual relationship with C. Whenever C tried to end her relationship with D, he sent her text messages purportedly from different 'police officers' telling her it was her duty to sleep with him, otherwise she would receive a fine. D was arrested and admitted sexual intercourse had taken place.

The prosecution sought to rely on  $s.76(2)(a)$ , arguing that C was deceived as to the nature and purpose of the act. The Court of Appeal ruled that s.76 was inapplicable. C had not been deceived as to the nature or purpose of the sexual intercourse, but only as to the situation she was in. This did not mean that she was consenting. Rather, the prosecution were compelled to do their job properly: that is, to prove her absence of consent by reference to s.74 (which it succeeded in doing). The effect of the deception was that the complainant had not exercised a free choice as to whether to have intercourse or not. D was convicted of rape.

### 8.3.2 The evidential presumptions

By s.75, where one of six different circumstances occur, it is a rebuttable evidential presumption that the complainant did not consent to the relevant act, and that the defendant did not believe that the complainant consented to the relevant act.

The key difference between these presumptions and the presumptions in s.76 is that the evidential presumptions can be rebutted by the raising of relevant evidence. This will generally not be easy, but it is possible. By virtue of s.75(2), the relevant circumstances are that:

- a. any person was, at the time of the relevant act or immediately before it began, using violence against the complainant or causing the complainant to fear that immediate violence would be used against him;
- b. any person was, at the time of the relevant act or immediately before it began, causing the complainant to fear that violence was being used, or that immediate violence would be used, against another person;
- c. the complainant was, and the defendant was not, unlawfully detained at the time of the relevant act:
- d. the complainant was asleep or otherwise unconscious at the time of the relevant act;
- e. because of the complainant's physical disability, the complainant would not have been able at the time of the relevant act to communicate to the defendant whether the complainant consented;
- f. any person had administered to or caused to be taken by the complainant, without the complainant's consent, a substance which, having regard to when it was administered or taken, was capable of causing or enabling the complainant to be stupefied or overpowered at the time of the relevant act.

All these situations involve circumstances where it is unlikely, without being impossible, that V consented and that D had reasonable grounds for believing that. If you think about it, it would be quite a rare circumstance for someone to have intercourse with a sleeping person who actually consents to the act. Rare but not impossible. The example often given is that of a couple who have got into the habit of having sex at night when the woman is asleep.

The procedure to be followed is that the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the circumstance existed (e.g. that V was asleep when D had intercourse with V). V is then presumed not to have consented and that D is presumed to have known that. Another example of an evidential presumption is where D used force or threat of force before or at the time of the relevant act. Again, upon proof of this, the prosecution will win its case without having to specifically prove absence of consent unless D is able to offer plausible evidence in rebuttal (e.g. by raising plausible evidence that sleeping sex was a regular consensual occurrence or, in the violence case, by raising plausible evidence that both parties were fetishists and were role playing with consent). If D does this successfully, the prosecution are back to square one and must prove absence of consent by reference to the statutory definition which appears in s.74. If the prosecution cannot do this, D is acquitted.

Section 75(2)(f) typically covers cases where D secretly introduces a 'date rape' drug such as rohypnol into V's drink or 'spikes' V's soft drink with alcohol. Section  $75(2)(f)$  does not require that V is stupefied or overpowered by the substance, only that the substance was capable of producing this effect. If the prosecution can prove that this substance was administered or caused to be taken, it is presumed that V did not consent to intercourse and that D had no reasonable grounds for believing that she did. Again, however, the defendant can rebut the presumption by raising plausible evidence that, notwithstanding D's subterfuge, V did consent to the act of intercourse (see Illustration 2). If he is successful, the prosecution must prove absence of consent by reference to s.74.

### 8.3.3 Section 74 – the statutory definition of consent

All the standard sexual offences, including rape and sexual assault, require the prosecution to prove that the victim did not consent to the sexual contact. As has been explained, the presumptions, where applicable, make the prosecution's task considerably easier in this respect. Where the presumptions do not apply, the prosecution must prove absence of consent by reference to s.74, which provides the nearest thing to a statutory definition. Prior to 2003, the very concept of consent was fragile. What is it to consent to sex? Does it require wholehearted acceptance? Does one consent to sex when one reluctantly acquiesces to avoid a big argument? This conceptual fragility led to huge problems in establishing its absence. In Olugboja [1982] QB 320, the victim's case was simple:

'I didn't consent, although I did not struggle. I was terrified and could do nothing to resist.' The defendant's case was equally simple: 'I did not threaten or use force on her. She consented.' The Court of Appeal was forced to duck the issue by relying on the 'good sense of the jury'. Dunn LJ said that:

the dividing line ... between real consent on the one hand and mere submission on the other may not be easy to draw. Where it is to be drawn in a given case is for the jury to decide, applying their combined good sense, experience and knowledge of human nature and modern behaviour to all the relevant facts of that case.

Section 74 does little to improve the situation. It defines consent, but in a very loose way, stating that 'a person consents if he agrees by choice, and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice'. The concerns are that 'freedom' and 'choice' are:

ideas which raise philosophical issues of such complexity as to be ill suited to the needs of criminal justice - clearly those words do not refer to total freedom of choice, so all the questions about how much liberty of action satisfies the 'definition' remain at large.

(Temkin, J. and A. Ashworth 'The Sexual Offences Act 2003: (1) Rape, sexual assaults and the problems of consent' (2004) Crim LR 328-46, 336.)

In Doyle [2010] EWCA Crim 119, a case involving the rape of the defendant's ex-partner, the defence noted the Judicial Studies Board Specimen Direction, no. 53, which embodied the direction given by Pill J in the trial of Mohammed Zafar:

A female partner may not particularly want sexual intercourse on a particular occasion, but because it is her husband or her partner who is asking for it, she will consent to sexual intercourse. The fact that such consent is given reluctantly or out of a sense of duty to her partner is still consent.

Although the SOA 2003 provides a statutory definition of consent, its indeterminacy has led to the Olugboja model continuing to be heavily influential in terms of jury directions in cases where consent is an issue. The jury's determination is final. In Kirk [2008] EWCA Crim 434, the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction of a defendant who had made sexual intercourse the condition of a gift of money needed by the young homeless victim to buy food. In so doing, it approved the distinction drawn by the trial judge between consent and 'mere submission', without clarifying it, which formed the basis of the decision in Olugboja. In R v Ali and Ashraf [2015] EWCA Crim 1279, the Court of Appeal ruled that, in the case of a vulnerable, immature complainant, who had been groomed by the defendants, the mere fact that, from the evidence presented (her statement to the police when interviewed), the complainant appeared to wholeheartedly consent to intercourse did not necessarily mean the jury were bound to accept that this apparent consent was freely given. This case illustrates how indeterminate the concept of consent is and how much responsibility lies with the jury.

#### Intoxication and consent

The case of Bree [2007] EWCA Crim 804 illustrates another of the circumstances rendering proof of consent problematic, namely intoxication. The fact of intoxication may affect both a person's capacity to consent and their freedom of choice. It may also disinhibit, which is perfectly consistent with consent. The defendant was a 25-yearold man of excellent previous character. After a very heavy evening drinking together, he had sexual intercourse with a young woman aged 19 years. He was charged and convicted of rape. The victim stated in evidence that, having lost consciousness, she awoke to find the defendant engaging in sex with her. The prosecution's case was that, although the complainant was not so drunk as to lack the capacity to consent, she did not in fact consent to intercourse. She knew that she did not want to have sexual intercourse, and, so far as she could, made that clear. The trial judge failed to put this case clearly to the jury and so the Court of Appeal quashed the conviction. How should the case have been put? The position appears to be as follows.

If the alcohol renders the victim unconscious or prevents the victim from knowing what is happening, then the victim does not consent due to lack of capacity. If the effect of the alcohol prevents the victim from communicating their lack of consent, they do not consent due to lack of free choice. Questions of proof will be paramount. If the effect of the alcohol is to cause the victim to engage in sexual activity, which they would not have done if sober, they still do consent. In this latter case, as was stated controversially in *Dougal* (2005), 'a drunken consent is still consent'.

In Kamki (2013), the Court of Appeal approved the following direction of the trial judge in another case involving sexual activity while intoxicated that raised questions of consent. The full quotation is given here, as it is very helpful:

A woman can have the capacity to make a choice to engage in sexual activity, even when she has had a lot to drink obviously. Alcohol can make people less inhibited than they are when they are sober and obviously everyone is free, we are all free to decide how much to drink and whether to have sex or not. However, if through drink a woman has temporarily lost her capacity to choose whether to have sexual intercourse or to engage in sexual activity of another sort, she would then not be consenting. Clearly as I have said, a person who is unconscious through the consumption of alcohol cannot give consent, and it may well be there is before that complete loss of consciousness, a state of incapacity to consent which can be reached.

So there are of course, and this is common sense again, various stages of consciousness, are there not, from being wide awake to having a dim awareness of reality. In a state of dim and drunken awareness, a person may not be in a condition to make choices, so you will need to consider the evidence carefully in this case as to what was M's state of consciousness or unconsciousness at the time of penetration and decide firstly was she in a condition in which she was capable of making a choice one way or the other. If you are sure that she was not, then she was obviously not consenting. If you conclude, however, that she was or may have been able to make a choice, you must decide whether she was or may have been consenting to sexual intercourse in relation to count one, penetration of her vagina in relation to count three and the touching of her breast in relation to count two.

#### Deception and consent

Does a person who agrees to sexual activity as a result of a deception, not falling within s.75 or s.76, 'agree by choice'? This depends, of course, on whether consent means informed consent. If A has intercourse with B, concealing from her that he is HIV positive, does he commit the actus reus of rape, given that consent would not have been granted had B known of his condition? The presumptions do not apply - A does not deceive B as to the nature or purpose of the act. Guilt depends therefore on whether consent is vitiated. In B [2006] EWCA Crim 2945, the Court of Appeal ruled that it was not vitiated for the purpose of the offence of rape but it was for the purpose of s.20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. The transmitter of the disease would therefore be quilty under s.20.

In R (Monica) v DPP (Boyling, interested party) (2018) EWHC 3508 (Admin), the consent of a woman to intercourse was held not to be vitiated by the fraudulent representation of her partner that he was a fellow environmental activist when in fact he was an undercover police officer attempting to infiltrate her organisation. Although it was accepted by the court that she would not have consented had she known his true identity, the judge ruled that deception did not generally vitiate consent except where s.76 applied, or where, as in Jheeta, other pressure was brought to bear. This is a puzzling decision, which puts into question the cogency of the 'free choice' concept at the heart of consent. It certainly fits ill with cases such as Kirk and Ali and Ashraf. If those complainants did not exercise genuine free choice, why did this complainant?

Two other important decisions also centre on the phrase 'agree by choice'. In Assange [2011] EWHC 2849 (Admin), a woman who had intercourse with a man on condition he wear a condom was held not to have consented to the intercourse when he failed to wear one. In R (on the application of F) v DPP [2013] EWHC 945 (Admin), a similar decision was reached when the condition was that the man should wear a condom or otherwise not ejaculate. These are controversial decisions, as in both cases the victim consented to the intercourse. There was no sexual 'violation'. Arguably, a better outcome would have been for the defendant to have been charged with common assault, since the contact the victim consented to (safe sex) was not the contact she received (see B above).

This reasoning was accepted in R v Lawrence [2020] EWCA Crim 971. On the basis of the defendant's deception that he had had a vasectomy and so was not fertile, the complainant agreed to sexual intercourse. He was charged with rape. The question for the court was whether his deception vitiated her consent. At first instance, the court found that it did. Quashing the conviction, the Court of Appeal ruled that, unlike the complainants in Assange and R (on the application of F) v DPP, the complainant here agreed to sexual intercourse with the appellant without imposing any physical restrictions. She agreed both to penetration of her vagina and to ejaculation without the protection of a condom. In so doing, she was deceived about the nature or quality of the ejaculate and therefore of the risks and possible consequences of unprotected intercourse. The deception was one which related not to the physical performance of the sexual act but to risks or consequences associated with it.

## 8.4 Procedure: relationship between ss.1, 75 and 74

It is important to understand the procedure to be adopted when there is an issue concerning the applicability of s.75. The following illustration concerns s.75(2)(f) but the procedure to be adopted is the same whichever of the circumstances is being relied upon.

### **Illustration 2**

D spikes V's drink with alcohol for the purpose of disinhibiting V. D's plan is successful and V has intercourse with D, as intended. V then discovers the deception and calls the police. D is prosecuted for rape.

The prosecution must normally prove:

- a. that V did not consent, and
- b. that D did not reasonably believe that V did consent.

In this case, however, the  $s.75(2)(f)$  presumption may apply. The procedure will be that if the prosecution can prove beyond reasonable doubt that D, or someone else, had spiked V's drink/food with an intoxicant and that the amount was capable of or sufficient to stupefy V or permit her to be overpowered, then D will be convicted, unless he can rebut the presumption. He will seek to do this by raising plausible evidence that, although V was under the influence, she nevertheless consented and/or that he reasonably believed V to be consenting. D will attempt to discharge this evidential burden, typically, by claiming that V said or did certain things which implied willingness. If this evidence is plausible, particularly if the alleged words or deeds of V were witnessed by another person, the burden of proof shifts back onto the prosecution to prove absence of consent (and absence of reasonable belief) in the ordinary way – that is, by reference to s.74. If this is what happens, the prosecution will try to discharge the burden of proof which has now returned to it by convincing the jury that a person who has intercourse with another, having been involuntarily intoxicated, does not consent in the sense of having a 'free choice', however willing they may have appeared to be. Equally, it will argue that any belief that D had that V's choice was free would be unreasonable given that he knew and indeed possibly relied on the fact that V had been drugged/intoxicated. The trial judge is entitled to withdraw the question as to whether D's belief was reasonable if there is insufficient evidence (Ciccarelli [2011] EWCA Crim 2665).

## 8.5 Mens rea

At common law, the prosecution was required to prove that the defendant lacked an honest belief that the victim was consenting. The defendant could escape liability even if his honest belief was not based upon reasonable grounds: DPP v Morgan [1976] AC 182. This created serious problems for victims in court. Under s.  $1(1)(c)$  SOA 2003, the mens rea requirement has changed. Honest belief in consent is not enough. The defendant's belief that the victim consents must be reasonable.

### 8.5.1 Intention to penetrate

An obvious, if little remarked upon, aspect of the mens rea for rape is that the defendant's non-consensual penetration of the complainant's vagina, anus or mouth must be intentional. It follows that, if in the course of consensual sexual foreplay involving genital contact, the defendant effects penetration unintentionally, the rape is not committed, even though the complainant did not consent to such penetration. A variation upon this scenario occurred in R v Gabbai [2019] EWCA Crim 2287, where the defendant engaged in consensual vaginal intercourse with the complainant in the course of which he penetrated her anus with his penis without her consent. On appeal against conviction for rape, the Court of Appeal, allowing the appeal, held that the trial judge erred in not directing the jury that it would not be rape if, when penetrating the complainant's anus, the defendant mistakenly thought he was penetrating the vagina.

### 8.5.2 Fault with regard to consent

At common law, the fault element in rape was, as with most serious crimes, subjective. It is now objective. If the defendant's defence is that he believed the complainant to be consenting, this will only avail him if, in the court's opinion, his belief is based upon reasonable grounds: s.1(1)(c) SOA 2003. Crucially, both s.75 and s.76 apply to this aspect of the fault element as well, as we have seen, in relation to the conduct element. When s.75 or s.76 applies, such a belief will be presumed, conclusively or evidentially, absent. Otherwise, whether a belief in consent is reasonable is a matter for the jury. However, the trial judge may withdraw the issue from the jury if there is insufficient evidence. In *Ciccarelli*, the accused had sexually assaulted the complainant while she slept. The s.75 presumption applied that she did not consent, as the complainant was unconscious and the defendant did not reasonably believe that she did consent. The accused attempted to rebut the presumption by giving evidence that he had grounds for believing she did consent. He said that he believed she would have consented because of a sexual advance made by her to him earlier on the evening in question. The trial judge in that case addressed s.75 and ruled that, whether or not the accused believed the victim was consenting, there was insufficient evidence that the accused's belief was reasonable. The judge said that she would direct the jury accordingly. As a result of this

ruling, the accused changed his plea to guilty. He appealed against conviction on the ground that the judge's ruling was wrong and that the jury should have been allowed to consider whether his belief was reasonable. In dismissing the appeal, the Lord Chief Justice said that the appellant's reasonable belief in the complainant's consent:

either when she was asleep or in any other of the situations identified in section 75(2) (in what we describe as a position of disadvantage) will be considered by the jury provided that there is evidence which is sufficient to raise that issue.

He agreed with the trial judge that there was no evidence upon which a reasonable person could possibly come to the conclusion that the victim would consent. The parties hardly knew each other and had never had any form of sexual contact.

Reasonableness has to be assessed, according to s.1(2) SOA 2003:

having regard to all the circumstances including any steps [the defendant] has taken to ascertain whether [the person] consents.

Whether a defendant's belief is reasonable or not is assessed objectively. It matters not that the defendant thought his belief was reasonable, if it was not. In B [2013] EWCA Crim 3, the defendant obliged his partner to have intercourse with him, having a delusion that he was a healer with special powers and that this would prevent his partner taking an improper interest in other men. The court concluded that delusional beliefs such as he undoubtedly had would not in law render reasonable a belief that his partner was consenting when in fact she was not. A delusional belief in consent is, by definition, an unreasonable one.

## Sample examination question 1

**Question**

Discuss D's possible criminal liability for rape in the following situations:

- a. D promises his girlfriend, V, a religious person who does not believe in sexual intercourse before marriage, that he will marry her if she has sexual intercourse with him. After intercourse takes place, D tells V that he did not mean what he said and ends the relationship;
- b. D, who looks like the film star George Clancy, induces V into having sexual intercourse with him, falsely representing that he is George Clancy;
- c. D, who is happily married to V, comes home to find her asleep and starts having sexual intercourse with her. She wakes up and tells him to stop;
- d. in a bar, D secretly buys V an alcoholic cocktail rather than the non-alcoholic drink she asked for. V does not notice the difference and becomes intoxicated. D drives V back to her flat where, after a long session of petting, they have sexual intercourse; and
- e. D and V, who are lovers, are having consensual intercourse, during which D says to V, 'I wish you were more passionate. You are not nearly as sexy as Marta (D's ex-wife)'. V angrily tells D to cease intercourse. D refuses, whereupon V shouts, 'Get off!' and begins to struggle. 'That's better', says D. 'Now you are showing a bit of passion' and continues to have intercourse with her.

A tip for future! When tackling multi-part questions, it is important to remember that each scenario is roughly the same level of difficulty, therefore, you should consider and answer each scenario roughly in same length and level of detail. You do not need to repeat yourself in the answers.

**+ Feedback**

Once you have set out the definition of rape under s.1 of Sexual Offences Act 2003, you do not need to repeat it and can just refer to above. In questions on sexual offences, it is always necessary to show detailed knowledge of the consent (ss.74–76) as relevant to the scenario and as interpreted in case law.

This is a question on rape with particular emphasis on consent and belief in consent requiring understanding of ss.74, 75 and 76 and the relationship between them. These answers are indicative:

a. Sections 75 and 76 are not, on the face of it, applicable. This is because deceptions falling outside s.76 normally do not vitiate consent unless fundamental, e.g. McNally to the act consented to. Cases like

Monica and Lawrance further support that deception would not vitiate consent as too far removed from the act.

- b. This is not on the face of it a  $s.76(2)(b)$  deception as the defendant was not known personally to the complainant but you should question whether looking like the film star and being known as that film star by the complainant makes a difference. Otherwise, deceptions falling outside s.76 normally do not vitiate consent. Cases like Monica and Lawrance further support that deception would not vitiate consent as too far removed from the act.
- c. Section  $75(2)(d)$  presumption this is rebuttable. You should explain how the presumption could be rebutted and how, in such a case, s.74 must be relied upon.
- d. Section 75(2)(f) is applicable but absence of consent and belief can be rebutted. You should explain how, especially in relation to the significance of the 'heavy petting' beforehand. In which case, you are back to square one needing to prove absence of consent by reference to s.74. Bree - standards of drunkenness/capacity.
- e. Section 78 includes failure to withdraw, old case law Kaitamaki makes same point. The issue here is reasonable belief in consent, not consent.

## Learning activity 2

Match the statements below to the most relevant case.

1. A woman who submits to sexual activity with a woman, deceived into believing the other person to be a man, does not consent for the purpose of section 74, and possibly also for the purpose of section 76.

2. A woman who permits a person to examine and touch her breasts, deceived into believing this is done for a medical purpose when i fact done for a sexual purpose is deceived as to the nature and purpose of the act for the purpose of section 76. She is conclusively presumed not to consent and the other is presumed to know this.

3. A person who continues to have intercourse with a woman after consent is withdrawn commits the actus reus of rape.

4. A woman who, in a relationship with Y, has intercourse with X, who is impersonating Y, is conclusively presumed not to consent for t purpose of section 76 and the other is presumed to know this.

5. A person does not consent to sexual activity, if through intoxication, they lack the capacity to consent or are unable to communicate of consent. If through intoxication they consent to sexual activity which they would not have consented to if sober, they do consent.

6. The line between true consent and mere submission is not easy to draw. It is a question for the jury 'applying their combined good s knowledge and experience of human nature.'

7. On the basis of the defendant's deception that he had had a vasectomy and so was not fertile, the complainant agreed to sexual intercourse. He was charged with rape. The question for the court was whether his deception vitiated her consent. The Court of Appea that it did not. She was not deceived as to the nature and purpose of the act, which was intercourse.
