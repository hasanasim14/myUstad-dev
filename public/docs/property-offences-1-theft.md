- Section 4 defines property
- Section 3 describes what it is to appropriate that ;property
- Section 2 gives a (partial) definition of what dishonesty means
- Section 5 defines what it means for property to belong to another person
- Section 6 gives a (partial) explanation of what 'intending to permanently deprive' means

## *Actus Reus* and *Mens Rea* of Theft

- *Actus Reus*  appropriation of property belonging to another
- *Mens Rea*  dishonesty coupled with an intention to permanently deprive the other of their property

Example

Adam, hairstylist to the stars, is asked by his friend Demien, an artist, if Adam would be prepared to collect and sell Demien the hair of various celebrities for a future artistic composition. Adam says he will think about it. A few days later, following a visit from the famous pop group, Brass Monkeys, Adam telephones Demien and says he will sell Demien the discarded hair of the group members for £5,000. An hour later he changes his mind and throws the hair away. Has Adam stolen the hair?

 *Actus Reus*: Question 1

Question 1 - Is hair property?

Section 4 – '"Property" includes money and all other property, real or personal, including things in action and other intangible property.'

 *Actus Reus*: Question 2

Question 2 - If hair is property, has Adam appropriated it?

Section 3(1) 'any assumption by a person of the rights of an owner amounts to an appropriation, and this includes, where he has come by the property (innocently or not) without stealing it, any later assumption of a right to it by keeping or dealing with it as owner'.

Question 3 – If we assume Adam has appropriated property, does the property (hair) appropriated belong to someone else?

Section 5(1) describes Property as belonging, to 'any person having possession or control of it, or having any proprietary right or interest (not being an equitable interest arising only from an agreement to transfer or grant an interest)'

## Mens Rea
Question 1 - Does Adam, when he appropriates the property, intend to permanently deprive the owner (whoever it is) of it?

Section 6(1) a person is to be treated as having an intention to permanently deprive the owner of his property if his intention is to treat the thing as his own to dispose of regardless of the other's rights; and a borrowing or lending of it may amount to so treating it if, but only if, the borrowing or lending is for a period and in circumstances making it equivalent to an outright taking or disposal.

Question 2 - Assuming all the other elements of theft are satisfied was the appropriation 'dishonest'.

Section 2(1) does not tell us what dishonesty is but it does tell us what it is not. An appropriation is not dishonest where a person appropriates property in the belief:

(a) that he has in law the right to deprive the other of it, on behalf of himself or of a third person; or

(b) that he would have the other's consent if the other knew of the appropriation and the circumstances of it; or

(c) . . . that the person to whom the property belongs cannot be discovered by taking reasonable steps.

## Concluding remarks

Always have the statute by your side and use your Module guide and activities to help you apply it.

## What have we learned in this lecture?

1. When analysing a theft problem, always start with the statute.

2. To help you make sense of the statute and how to apply it always use your Topic Reading and Activities. They are the bridge between you and success at theft.
