How reading a case can help you

- To understand the present law
- To reason your way through to a conclusion where the law needs developing

## Facts
The facts in the defendants own words

"Last night I went out for a few drinks and at closing time I went back to the house where I have been kipping for a couple of weeks…

I went upstairs into the back bedroom where I've been sleeping. I lay on my mattress and lit a cigarette..

I must have fell to sleep because I woke up to find the mattress on fire. I just got up and went into the next room and went back to sleep. Then the next thing I remember was the police and fire people arriving. I hadn't got anything to put the fire out with so I just left it."

- The Charge
- "arson contrary to section 1 (1) and (3) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971"; t
- The particulars of offence :
- "on a date unknown between August 13 and 16, 1980, without lawful excuse the defendant damaged by fire a house known as No. 9, Grantham Road, Sparkbrook, intending to do damage to such property or recklessly as to whether such property would be damaged."

## The verdict

**The Verdict**

• Convicted by jury at Leicester Crown Court.

### **The Appeal**

• "the undisputed facts does not disclose any offence under section 1 of the Criminal Damage Act 1971."

The appeal was dismissed, but leave to appeal to the House of Lords was granted on the ground that an important question of law was involved, namely:

• "Whether the actus reus of the offence of arson is present when a defendant accidentally starts a fire and thereafter, intending to destroy or damage property belonging to another or being reckless as to whether any such property would be destroyed or damaged, fails to take any steps to extinguish the fire or prevent damage to such property by that fire?"


## The defence and prosecution case

 I did not **intentionally or recklessly** damage the property. Although I did damage the property, I did so while I was asleep and so I did not damage it with the *mens rea* required by s.1(1) of the CDA 1971

### **The Prosecution Case**

You **did** damage the property intentionally or recklessly for 2 alternative reasons:

- 1. Arson is a result crime. The **actus reus** lasts right until the fire is extinguished. (arson involves an act which continues until the fire is out). You woke up before the fire was out and as soon as you realised what had happened you became reckless as to the further damage which would be caused if you did nothing about it )
- 2. Alternatively the *actus reus* of criminal damage includes an omission in breach of duty and a duty existed here to remedy the dangerous situation which you had caused. Your omission to put the fire out was accompanied by knowledge that this would cause further damage, in other words you were reckless.

## Why is Miller so important
*actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea*

1. It tells us something new. An actus reus is not simply a bodily movement which finishes when the body stops moving. It is a dynamic which, in result crimes, lasts until the result is complete.

This is how Lord Diplock explains this idea:

"I cannot see any good reason why, so far as liability under criminal law is concerned, it should matter at what point of time before the resultant damage is complete a person becomes aware that he has done a physical act which, whether or not he appreciated that it would at the time when he did it, does in fact create a risk that property of another will be damaged; provided that, at the moment of awareness, it lies within his power to take steps, either himself or by calling for the assistance of the fire brigade if this be necessary, to prevent or minimise the damage to the property at risk."

2. It extends the previous range of duty situations which were limited to statutory duties and duties arising out of special relationships and from the voluntary assumptions of responsibility.

A duty of intervention also now exists to remedy any dangerous situation which a person is responsible for creating.

3. It is a crucial reminder to you, the student, that the criminal law is not a set of static rules but a fluctuating body of principles tempered in the fire of legal argument in court.

• This is how changes to the criminal law occur. The new compulsory question is designed to encourage you to practise this kind of reasoning and argument.

4. Miller qualifies the principle that actus reus and mens rea coincide in point of time.

The defendant's case was that he admitted the act (setting light to the bed), he admitted that he realised, upon waking up, that the fire could spread (mens rea). His argument was that actus reus and mens rea did not coincide. When the act was done he was asleep and so had no mens rea. When he awoke and the mens rea was formed the act was over and so there was no accompanying actus reus . Miller tells us that this reasoning was false.


5. Miller has the potential to create a completely new approach to understanding when a duty of intervention arises in cases of omission. It tells us that a duty arises whenever a person is 'responsible for the creation of a dangerous situation' to remedy that situation. This is only a step or two behind saying that a duty arises whenever a person is a factual cause of a dangerous situation.


## Alternative scenario

- Lets change the facts of Miller very slightly. Assume the fire had been started by Miller's bedmate and he awoke to find bedmate gone and the bed smouldering. Would he be still guilty of arson if he did not put the fire out or call the fire brigade?

- On the face of it he would not be. First, the fire was not caused by his act and so there was no 'continuing act'. Second, the case tells us that the duty arises because Miller was responsible for creating the dangerous situation whereas here it was the bedmate whose responsibility this was.

- However, if this case came to court you can be sure that there would be a very strong argument put by prosecuting counsel that the principle in *Miller* should be extended to include **all people who are part of the causal chain** which led to the dangerous situation. This would include Mr Miller as they had entered the house together and gone to bed together. The fire is not his doing but it would not have happened without him. In other words he is a factual cause.

- The courts are half way to accepting this radical change in how we view the principles underlying the creation of new duty situations. In Evans, the supplier of drugs to the deceased who took them voluntarily, was held to be under a duty to provide help when the deceased went into a coma. She had not 'created the dangerous situation'. The deceased had. But she had 'contributed' to it and this was enough. If the Miller bedmate case came up in an examination this is the kind of reasoning which you should adopt. Do not simply apply the existing law. Make use of it by arguing for a principled development of the law based upon what you think Miller should have done and why.
