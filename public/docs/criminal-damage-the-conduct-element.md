Prof William Wilson

Criminal law

## Criminal Damage Act 1971

• The Act is designed to simplify the law and to ensure consistency with other property offences (principally theft).

## Basic Criminal Damage

• s.1 (1) A person who without lawful excuse destroys or damages property belonging to another intending to destroy or damage any such property or being reckless whether any such property would be destroyed or damaged shall be guilty of an offence.

## The Conduct Elements

- 1. The defendant must destroy or damage property
- 2. The property must belong to another person
- 3. There must be no lawful excuse

## What Counts as Criminal Damage?

### Actus Reus

- *(i) "destroys or damages"*
  - Any alteration to the physical nature of the property may amount to damage depending on the circumstances.
- *Roe* v. *Kingerlee* [1986] CrimLR 735
  - "What constitutes criminal damage is a matter of fact and degree and it is for the magistrates, applying their common sense, to decide whether what occurred was damage or not."
  - Cf *A (a juvenile) v R* (1978)
  - D smeared mud graffiti on the wall of a prison cell. DC Held: this was criminal damage although removal required only the application of water

### Nature of the property

- Whether something has been damaged is a question of fact and degree. The nature of the property must be taken into consideration
- Compare *Roe v Kingerlee* with *A (a juvenile) v R* (1978) and *Morphitis v Salmon*


### Damaging by rendering a whole machine inoperable?

- *Fisher* (1865) LR 1 CCR 7
- Temporary impairment is sufficient
- *Lloyd* v *DPP* [1991] Crim LR 904 at 906

## Belonging to another

### **Section 10 Interpretation**

(2) Property shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as belonging to any person:

(c) having a charge on it.

(3) Where property is subject to a trust, the persons to whom it belongs shall be so treated as including any person having a right t enforce the trust.
