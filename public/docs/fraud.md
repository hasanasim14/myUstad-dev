Professor William Wilson

## Fraud and Similar Offences

- 1. Fraud is an offence by section 2 Fraud Act 2006.
- 2. Obtaining Services by Deception is an offence by section 11 Fraud Act 2006
- 3. Making Off without Payment is an offence by section 3 Theft Act 1978

 Fraud can be committed in three ways:

- 1. by false representation
- 2. by failure to disclose information
- 3. by abuse of position


## Section 2 – Fraud by False Representation

2 (1) A person is in breach of this section if he –

- (a) dishonestly makes a false representation, and
- (b) intends, by making the representation
  - (i) to make a gain for himself or another, or
  - (ii) to cause loss to another or to expose another to a risk of loss

 *Actus Reus:* "Making a False representation"

False representations can be made:

- Expressly
- Impliedly
- By conduct

## *Actus Reus*: A false representation

 By subsection (2) A representation is false if—

- (a) it is untrue or misleading, and
- (b) the person making it knows that it is, or might be, untrue or misleading.

## *Actus Reus*: Case study

Adam goes into Rustbucket Cars and asks to see some low mileage second hand cars. One attracts him particularly and he asks Eve, the salesperson, 'How many miles does this car do to the gallon?' ' 60' says Eve although she knows it only does 60mph for motorway driving and that it does only 35 mph under average conditions.

## *Actus Reus*: Silence and Representations

A person does not make a false representation by not informing the other person of something relevant to the transaction. This is subject to two exceptions.

- a. Change of Circumstances
- b. Legal duty of disclosure

## **Case Study**

Adam, a car salesman truthfully tells Eve that a particular car is the latest model. On the strength of that representation Eve agrees to buy the car. By the time Eve comes to collect and pay for the car a new model becomes available. Adam fails to tell Eve this and she buys the car.

## Section 3 - Fraud by Failure to Disclose

### **Where Section 3 Fraud Act Applies**

(1) It applies if the defendant–

(a) dishonestly fails to disclose information to another person, which he is under a legal duty to disclose,

S## **Case Study**

Adam belongs to a golf club which permits members to invite guests, upon payment by the member of a fee. He invites Eve, a non member, to play. He decides dishonestly not to inform the golf club and does not pay the fee.

1. **Dishonesty**

- Section 2 does not apply to property offences other than theft. Ivey does apply.
- 2. **Intention to make a gain or cause a loss** (2(1) Fraud Act)
