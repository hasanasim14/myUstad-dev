### Introduction

The law of rape is contained in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (SOA 2003). This Act reordered and restructured all sexual offences, whose rationale and structure reflected their piecemeal development through the common law, the Sexual Offences Act 1956 and the later amendments thereto. The overall philosophy is to

provide coherent and clear sex offences which protect individuals, especially the more vulnerable, from abuse and exploitation, enable abusers to be appropriately punished, and be fair and non-discriminatory in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act 1998.

Part 1 of the SOA 2003 enacts the newly constituted structure of sexual offences that includes rape, assault by penetration, sexual assault and causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent. It deals with the issue of consent and, in particular, seeks to simplify the process of establishing absence of consent by the use of presumptions. It also covers child sex offences including those taking place within a family context. Part 2 is largely a re-enactment of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 containing measures for the protection of the public. In this chapter we will be examining just one sexual offence, namely rape.

**page 97**
### 8.1 Sexual Offences Act 2003, s.1 – rape**

- (1) A person (A) commits an offence if—
  - (a) he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (b) with his penis,
  - (b) B does not consent to the penetration, and
  - (c) A does not reasonably believe that B consents.
- (2) Whether a belief is reasonable is to be determined having regard to all the circumstances, including any steps A has taken to ascertain whether B consents.
- (3) Sections 75 and 76 apply to an offence under this section.
- (4) A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for life.

### **8.2 Conduct elements**

The *actus reus* of rape involves the non-consensual penetration of the mouth, anus or vagina of a man or a woman by a man's penis. Penetration by the penis is key to the *actus reus* of rape. Penetration of the vagina, anus or mouth with the tongue or finger or with objects such as broom handles, bottles or dildos is not rape. Where the orifice penetrated in this way is a vagina or anus, the penetration constitutes the separate offence of (sexual) assault by penetration (SOA 2003, s.2). In the case of the mouth, it is the offence of sexual assault.

By SOA 2003 s.79(2), 'Penetration is a continuing act from entry to withdrawal.' This enshrines the pre-SOA 2003 decision in *Kaitamaki* [1985] AC 147 that a man who continues to have intercourse after consent is withdrawn commits the *actus reus* of rape. Rape is an offence which can only be committed by a man, but, since the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, it can be committed on either a man or a woman. Any non-consensual penetrative vaginal, oral and anal sex constitutes rape. Ejaculation is not necessary (*R (on the application of F)* v *DPP* [2013] EWHC 945 (Admin)). By s.79(3), 'vagina' includes surgically constructed vaginas following gender reassignment surgery.

Rape has, since 1992, been possible between man and wife. Before this, the consent of the wife was presumed unless the marriage had terminated. Henceforth, the consent of the wife must be forthcoming and all the provisions of the SOA 2003 apply to determine whether it is.

### **8.3 Absence of consent**

In most cases of rape the main problem for the prosecution is proving absence of consent. The problem has been described as linked with the 'infinite circumstances of human behaviour, usually taking place in private without independent evidence, and the consequent difficulties of proving this very serious offence' (*Bree* [2007] per Hallett J at [36]). Until the passing of the Act, the difficulty of proving lack of consent to a standard of beyond reasonable doubt, created substantial problems for the victims of rape. These problems were compounded by inflexible and insensitive rules of procedure and evidence by which the victim, as the prime prosecution witness, was routinely forced to defend themselves against intrusive questioning designed to portray the victim as a woman of loose morals who was unlikely to have refused consent. This led to the charge that the criminal justice system did not take rape seriously, and tended to prioritise the rights of the accused over those of the victim.

The SOA 2003 has sought to address that charge and to ease the burden of the prosecution by having a number of conclusive presumptions (s.76) and evidential presumptions (s.75). The effect of these is that, where these apply, there will rarely be any need for the victim to be cross-examined on the question of consent; it will be presumed absent. If neither s.75 nor s.76 applies the prosecution are required to prove absence of consent in the usual way by way of reference to s.74. The prosecution will, therefore, be anxious to establish that a presumption does apply if possible since it will <span id="page-97-0"></span>ease its burden considerably. **As a student you should follow the same route. First consider whether a presumption applies and only if it does not consider whether s.74 is satisfied.**

**page 98**
### **8.4 The presumptions**

The SOA 2003 imposes two types of presumptions:

- u Conclusive presumptions, s.76. These cannot be rebutted.
- u Evidential presumptions, s.75. These can be rebutted by raising evidence that, notwithstanding the circumstance relied upon, the victim nevertheless did consent.

#### **8.4.1 Conclusive presumptions**

By s.76 it is conclusively presumed **both** that V did not consent and D did not reasonably believe V to consent in the following circumstances:

The job of the prosecution, therefore, is to try to establish beyond reasonable doubt either of these two circumstances. If it succeeds the case is won without having to establish anything else.

- (2)...(a) the defendant intentionally deceived the complainant as to the nature or purpose of the relevant act;
  - (b) the defendant intentionally induced the complainant to consent to the relevant act by impersonating a person known personally to the complainant.

##### **Section 76(2)(a)**

A pre-SOA 2003 example of the first presumption is *Williams* [1923] 1 KB 340. D, a singing teacher, told V, his pupil that it was necessary to perform an act in order to improve her singing. She agreed, not knowing or understanding that the act she was engaging in was sexual intercourse. It was held that her consent was vitiated by fraud as to the **nature and quality** of the act. What V was consenting to and what she thought she was consenting to were completely different in their nature. Compare *Linekar* [1995] QB 250, where it was held not to be a deception as to the nature and quality of the act for a person to trick a prostitute into having intercourse without payment. What she agreed to is what she got. It is possible that this case might be decided differently under the SOA 2003 since V could plausibly argue that although she consented to the nature of the act, she did not consent to its **purpose**. The purpose for her after all was financial not sexual. However, in *Jheeta* [2007] EWCA Crim 1699 the Court of Appeal stated that where this presumption is raised it should be the subject of 'stringent scrutiny' since, if accepted, **it is conclusive on the question of guilt**.

##### **Activity 8.1**

**a. In** *Newland* **(2015) (unreported) a woman, pretending to be a man, had penetrative sex with another woman who believed her lover to be a man. Is this a case where the conclusive presumption will apply?** 

**After you have considered your answer, read Wilson, Section 12.7.A.2 'Fraud – conclusive presumptions' to find out if you are right.** 

**b. Read the summary and explanation of** *Devonald* **in the above section of Wilson. Is it consistent with** *Linekar***? If** *Linekar* **were decided today would it be decided any differently?**

**No feedback provided.**

##### **Section 76(2)(b)**

Before the SOA 2003, a man who induced a person to have sexual intercourse with him by impersonating their partner committed rape. So it was rape when the defendant, the twin brother of V's boyfriend, had intercourse with V by pretending to be the brother: *Elbekkay* [1994] EWCA Crim 1. The SOA 2003 extends the old rules on impersonation in that consent is vitiated not only when it is the complainant's partner or spouse who is impersonated but also when it is any person 'known personally to the complainant'. No doubt there will be some interesting cases arising out of social networking friendships concerned with establishing exactly what 'known personally to the defendant' means. The key point to remember is that the presumption only applies where the person impersonated is known personally to the complainant.

**page 99**
##### **Illustration 8.1**

**D tells V he is Brad Potts, a famous film star in order to secure her consent to sexual activity. He is not Brad Potts although he looks a lot like him. V engages in sexual activity with him believing him to be Brad Potts.**

This is not a case where the presumption applies because, although V believes D to be Brad Potts, her mistaken belief is not about the person she is having sex with but about his name and attributes. This is because Brad Potts is not known personally to her. This is not to say that V does consent to the activity but only that, if she does not consent, it is not by virtue of the conclusive presumption. To secure a conviction, the prosecution will need to establish that s.74 applies, i.e. that, given the deception, the activities engaged in were not 'freely chosen' See *Jheeta*, below.

##### **Section 76: questions of procedure**

The procedure, where there is an issue that consent may be vitiated by one of the circumstances in s.76, is that the prosecution will seek to establish the existence of that circumstance. If that fails, the prosecution will then seek to negate consent by relying on s.74. This is what occurred in *Jheeta* (2007). D began a sexual relationship with C. Whenever C tried to end her relationship with D, he sent her text messages purportedly from different 'police officers' telling her it was her duty to sleep with him, otherwise she would receive a fine. D was arrested and admitted sexual intercourse had taken place.

The prosecution sought to rely on s.76(2)(a) arguing that C was deceived as to the nature and purpose of the Act. The Court of Appeal ruled that s.76 was inapplicable. C had not been deceived as to the nature or purpose of the sexual intercourse but only as to the situation she was in. This did not mean that she was consenting. Rather, the prosecution were compelled to do their job properly, i.e. to prove her absence of consent by reference to s.74, which it succeeded in doing. The effect of the deception was that the complainant had not exercised a free choice as to whether to have intercourse or not. He was convicted of rape.

#### **8.4.2 The evidential presumptions**

By s.75, where one of six different circumstances occur, it is a **rebuttable** evidential presumption that the complainant did not consent to the relevant act, and that the defendant did not believe that the complainant consented to the relevant act.

The key difference between these presumptions and the presumptions in s.76 is that the evidential presumptions can be rebutted by the raising of relevant evidence. This will generally not be easy but it is possible.

- (3) The circumstances are that—
  - (a) any person was, at the time of the relevant act or immediately before it began, using violence against the complainant or causing the complainant to fear that immediate violence would be used against him;
  - (b) any person was, at the time of the relevant act or immediately before it began, causing the complainant to fear that violence was being used, or that immediate violence would be used, against another person;
  - (c) the complainant was, and the defendant was not, unlawfully detained at the time of the relevant act;
  - (d) the complainant was asleep or otherwise unconscious at the time of the relevant act;

**page 100**
- (e) because of the complainant's physical disability, the complainant would not have been able at the time of the relevant act to communicate to the defendant whether the complainant consented;
- (f) any person had administered to or caused to be taken by the complainant, without the complainant's consent, a substance which, having regard to when it was administered or taken, was capable of causing or enabling the complainant to be stupefied or overpowered at the time of the relevant act.

All these situations involve circumstances where it is unlikely, without being impossible, that V consented and that D had reasonable grounds for believing that. If you think about it, it would be quite a rare circumstance for someone to have intercourse with a sleeping person who actually consents to the act. Rare but not impossible. The example often given is that of a couple who have got into the habit of having sex at night when the woman is asleep.

The procedure to be followed is that the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the circumstance existed (e.g. that V was asleep when D had intercourse with V). V is then presumed not to have consented and that D is presumed to have known that. Another example of an evidential presumption is where D used force or threat of force before or at the time of the relevant act. Again, upon proof of this, the prosecution will win its case without having to specifically prove absence of consent unless D is able to offer plausible evidence in rebuttal (e.g. by raising plausible evidence that sleeping sex was a regular consensual occurrence or, in the violence case, by raising plausible evidence that both parties were fetishists and were role playing with consent). If D does this successfully the prosecution are back to square one and must prove absence of consent by reference to the statutory definition which appears in s.74. If D does not, he is convicted.

Section 75(2)(f) typically covers cases where D secretly introduces a 'date rape' drug such as rohypnol into V's drink or 'spikes' V's soft drink with alcohol. Section 75(2)(f) does not require that V is stupefied or overpowered by the substance only that the substance was capable of producing this effect. If the prosecution can prove that this substance was administered or caused to be taken it is presumed that V did not consent to intercourse and that D had no reasonable grounds for believing that she did. Again, however, the defendant can rebut the presumption by raising plausible evidence that notwithstanding D's subterfuge V did consent to the act of intercourse (see Illustration 8.2). If he is successful the prosecution must prove absence of consent by reference to s.74.

#### **8.4.3 Section 74 – the statutory definition of consent**

All the standard sexual offences, including rape, require the prosecution to prove the victim did not consent. The presumptions, as have been explained, make the prosecution's task considerably easier in this respect, where applicable. Where the presumptions are not applicable, the prosecution must prove absence of consent by reference to s.74, which provides the nearest thing to a statutory definition. Prior to 2003, the very concept of consent was fragile. What is it to consent to sex? Does it require wholehearted acceptance? Does one consent to sex when one reluctantly acquiesces to avoid a big argument? This conceptual fragility led to huge problems in establishing its absence. In *Olugboja* [1982] QB 320 the victim's case was simple: 'I didn't consent, although I did not struggle. I was terrified and could do nothing to resist'.

The defendant's case was equally simple: 'I did not threaten or use force on her. She consented'. The Court of Appeal was forced to duck the issue by relying on the 'good sense of the jury'. Dunn LJ said that:

the dividing line ... between real consent on the one hand and mere submission on the other may not be easy to draw. Where it is to be drawn in a given case is for the jury to decide, applying their combined good sense, experience and knowledge of human nature and modern behaviour to all the relevant facts of that case.

Section 74 does little to improve the situation. It defines consent, but in a very loose way, stating that 'a person consents if he agrees by choice, and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice'. The concerns are that 'freedom' and 'choice' are:

**page 101**
*ideas which raise philosophical issues of such complexity as to be ill suited to the needs of criminal justice – clearly those words do not refer to total freedom of choice, so all the questions about how much liberty of action satisfies the 'definition' remain at large.*

*(Temkin, J. and A. Ashworth 'The Sexual Offences Act 2003: (1) Rape, sexual assaults and the problems of consent' (2004) *Crim LR* 328–46, 336.)*

In *Doyle* [2010] EWCA Crim 119, a case involving the rape of the defendant's ex-partner, the defence noted the Judicial Studies Board Specimen Direction, no. 53, which embodied the direction given by Pill J in the trial of Mohammed Zafar:

*A female partner may not particularly want sexual intercourse on a particular occasion, but because it is her husband or her partner who is asking for it, she will consent to sexual intercourse. The fact that such consent is given reluctantly or out of a sense of duty to her partner is still consent.*

Although the SOA 2003 provides a statutory definition of consent, its indeterminacy has led to the *Olugboja* model continuing to be heavily influential in terms of jury directions in cases where consent is an issue. In *Kirk* [2008] EWCA Crim 434 the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction of a defendant who had made sexual intercourse the condition of a gift of money needed by the young homeless victim to buy food. In so doing it approved the distinction drawn by the trial judge between consent and 'mere submission', without clarifying it, which formed the basis of the decision in *Olugboja*. In *R* v *Ali and Ashraf* [2015] EWCA Crim 1279 the Court of Appeal ruled that in the case of a vulnerable, immature complainant, who had been groomed by the defendants, the mere fact that from the evidence presented the latter appeared to consent to intercourse did not necessarily mean the jury were bound to accept that this apparent consent was freely chosen.

##### **Intoxication and consent**

The case of *Bree* [2007] EWCA Crim 804 illustrates another of the circumstances rendering proof of consent problematic, namely intoxication. The fact of intoxication may affect both a person's capacity to consent and their freedom of choice. It may also disinhibit, which is perfectly consistent with consent. The defendant was a 25-year-old man of excellent previous character. After a very heavy evening drinking together, he had sexual intercourse with a young woman aged 19 years. He was charged and convicted of rape. The victim stated in evidence that having lost consciousness she awoke to find the defendant engaging in sex with her. The prosecution case was that although the complainant was not so drunk as to lack the capacity to consent, she did not in fact consent to intercourse. She knew that she did not want to have sexual intercourse, and so far as she could, made that clear. The trial judge failed to put this case clearly to the jury and so the Court of Appeal quashed the conviction. How should the case have been put? The position appears to be as follows.

If the alcohol renders the victim unconscious or prevents the victim from knowing what is happening, then the victim does not consent due to lack of **capacity**. If the effect of the alcohol prevents the victim from communicating their lack of consent, they do not consent due to lack of **free choice**. Questions of proof will be paramount. If the effect of the alcohol is to cause the victim to engage in sexual activity, which they would not have done if sober, they still do consent. In this latter case, as was stated controversially in *Dougal* (Unreported, 2005), 'a drunken consent is still consent'.

In *Kamki* [2013] EWCA Crim 2335 the Court of Appeal approved the following direction of the trial judge in another case involving sexual activity while intoxicated raising questions of consent. The full quotation is given here as it is very helpful.

A woman can have the capacity to make a choice to engage in sexual activity, even when she has had a lot to drink obviously. Alcohol can make people less inhibited than they are when they are sober and obviously everyone is free, we are all free to decide how much to drink and whether to have sex or not. However, if through drink a woman has temporarily lost her capacity to choose whether to have sexual intercourse or to engage in sexual activity of another sort, she would then not be consenting. Clearly as I have said, a person who is unconscious through the consumption of alcohol cannot give consent, and it may well be there is before that complete loss of consciousness, a state of incapacity to consent which can be reached.

**page 102**
So there are of course, and this is common sense again, various stages of consciousness, are there not, from being wide awake to having a dim awareness of reality. In a state of dim and drunken awareness, a person may not be in a condition to make choices, so you will need to consider the evidence carefully in this case as to what was M's state of consciousness or unconsciousness at the time of penetration, and decide firstly was she in a condition in which she was capable of making a choice one way or the other. If you are sure that she was not, then she was obviously not consenting. If you conclude, however, that she was or may have been able to make a choice, you must decide whether she was or may have been consenting to sexual intercourse in relation to count one, penetration of her vagina in relation to count three and the touching of her breast in relation to count two.

##### **Deception and consent**

Does a person who agrees to sexual activity as a result of a deception, not falling within s.75 or 76, 'agree by choice'? This depends, of course, on whether consent means informed consent. If A has intercourse with B concealing from her that he is HIV positive, does he commit the *actus reus* of rape, given that consent would not have been granted had B known of his condition? The presumptions do not apply – A does not deceive B as to the nature or purpose of the act. Guilt depends therefore on whether consent is vitiated. In *B* [2006] EWCA Crim 2945 the Court of Appeal ruled that it was not vitiated for the purpose of the offence of rape but it was for the purpose of s.20. The transmitter of the disease would therefore be guilty under s.20.

In *R (Monica)* v *DPP* [2018] EWHC 3508 (Admin) the consent of a woman to intercourse was held not to be vitiated by the fraudulent representation of her partner that he was a fellow environmental activist when in fact he was an undercover police officer attempting to infiltrate her organisation. Although it was accepted by the court that she would not have consented had she known his true identity, the judge ruled that deception did not generally vitiate consent except where s.76 applied, or where, as in *Jheeta*, other pressure was brought to bear. This is a puzzling decision, which puts into question the cogency of the 'free choice' concept at the heart of consent. It certainly fits ill with cases such as *Kirk*, and *Ali and Ashraf*. If those complainants did not exercise genuine free choice, why did this complainant?

The Court of Appeal has gone some way to accepting this reasoning in the recent case of *R* v *Lawrence* [2020] EWCA Crim 971. On the basis of the defendant's deception that he had had a vasectomy and so was not fertile, the complainant agreed to sexual intercourse. The defendant was charged with rape. The question for the Court was whether his deception vitiated her consent. At first instance, the Court found that it did. Quashing the conviction, the Court of Appeal ruled that

unlike the woman in *Assange and R (on the application of F)* v *DPP,* the complainant agreed to sexual intercourse with the appellant without imposing any physical restrictions. She agreed both to penetration of her vagina and to ejaculation without the protection of a condom. In so doing she was deceived about the nature or quality of the ejaculate and therefore of the risks and possible consequences of unprotected intercourse. The deception was one which related not to the physical performance of the sexual act but to risks or consequences associated with it.

### **8.5 Procedure: relationship between s.1, s.75 and s.74**

It is important to understand the procedure to be adopted when there is an issue concerning the applicability of s.75. The following illustration concerns s.75(2)(f) but the procedure to be adopted is the same whichever of the circumstances is being relied on.

**page 103**
#### **Illustration 8.2**

**D spikes V's drink with alcohol for the purpose of disinhibiting V. V then has intercourse with D, as D planned. V then discovers the deception and calls the police. D is prosecuted for rape.**

The prosecution must normally prove:

- a. that V did not consent, and
- b. that D did not reasonably believe that V did consent.

In this case, however, the s.75(2)(f) presumption may apply. The procedure will be that if the prosecution can prove beyond reasonable doubt that D, or someone else, had spiked V's drink/food with an intoxicant and that the amount was capable of or sufficient to stupefy V or permit her to be overpowered, then D will be convicted, **unless he can rebut the presumption**. He will seek to do this by raising plausible evidence that, although V was under the influence, she nevertheless consented, and/or that he reasonably believed V to be consenting. D will attempt to discharge this evidential burden, typically, by claiming that V said or did certain things which implied willingness. If this evidence is plausible, particularly if the alleged words or deeds of V were witnessed by another person, the burden of proof shifts back onto the prosecution to prove absence of consent (and absence of reasonable belief) in the ordinary way, that is, by reference to s.74. If this is what happens the prosecution will try to discharge the burden of proof that has now returned to them by convincing the jury that a person who has intercourse with another, having been involuntarily intoxicated, does not consent in the sense of having a 'free choice', however willing they may have appeared to be. Equally, it will argue that any belief that D had that V's choice was free would be unreasonable given that he knew and indeed possibly relied on the fact that V had been drugged/intoxicated. The trial judge is entitled to withdraw the question as to whether D's belief was reasonable if there was insufficient evidence (*Ciccarelli* [2011] EWCA Crim 2665).

#### **Activity 8.2**

**Read Wilson, Sections 12.7.A.1 'Relevance of fraud or force – presumptions', 12.7.A.2 'Fraud – conclusive presumptions' and 12.7.A.3 'Evidential presumptions', and answer the following questions.** 

**With particular reference to the presumptions in the SOA 2003, is there consent in the following situations? And how, if at all, could the presumption be rebutted?**

- **a. Donald and Vera have sexual intercourse. Donald had promised Vera money for doing so, but left without paying.**
- **b. Donald tricks Wendy into having sexual intercourse with him by pretending to be George Clouseau, a famous film actor.**
- **c. Frank is Beatrice's facebook friend. They have been friends for several months. They have sent each other photographs. Donald, Franks's twin brother, finds out about their relationship and, pretending to be Frank, arranges to meet Beatrice in a pub. Later that evening he invites her to his apartment where, still pretending to be Frank, he proposes intercourse which she agrees to.**
- **d. Donald, who is happily married to Xenia, comes home to find her asleep and starts having sexual intercourse with her. She wakes up and tells him to stop.**
- **e. In a bar, Donald buys Yvonne an alcoholic cocktail rather than the non-alcoholic drink she asked for. Yvonne does not notice the difference and, not being used to alcohol, becomes drunk. Donald drives Yvonne back to her flat where they have sexual intercourse.**
- **f. Donald meets Violet in a singles bar. He invites her back to his apartment, where, after having a few drinks, he takes out a pair of hand cuffs. He says to Violet, 'We are going to have sex now and I am going to put these on you'. He does so and they have sex.**

**page 104**
### **8.6** *Mens rea*

At common law the prosecution were required to prove that the defendant lacked an honest belief that the victim was consenting. The defendant could escape liability even if his honest belief was not based upon reasonable grounds: *DPP* v *Morgan* [1976] AC 182. This created serious problems for victims in court. Under the SOA 2003 s.1(1)(c), the *mens rea* requirement has changed. Honest belief in consent is not enough. The defendant's belief that the victim consents must be reasonable.

#### **8.6.1 Intention to penetrate**

An obvious, if under-remarked, aspect of the *mens rea* for rape is that the defendant's non-consensual penetration of the complainant's vagina, anus or mouth is intentional. It follows that, if in the course of consensual sexual foreplay involving genital contact, the defendant effects penetration unintentionally, the rape is not committed even though the complainant did not consent to such penetration. A variation upon this scenario occurred in *R* v *Gabbai* [2019] EWCA Crim 2287 where the defendant engaged in consensual vaginal intercourse with the complainant in the course of which he penetrated her anus with his penis without her consent. On appeal against conviction for rape, the Court of Appeal, allowing the appeal, held that the trial judge erred in not directing the jury that it would not be rape if, when penetrating the complainant's anus, the defendant mistakenly thought he was penetrating the vagina.

#### **8.6.2 Fault in regard to consent**

At common law, the fault element in rape was, as with most serious crimes, subjective. The prosecution was required to prove that the defendant lacked an honest belief that the victim was consenting. The defendant could escape liability even if his honest belief was not based upon reasonable grounds: *DPP* v *Morgan* [1976] AC 182. This created serious problems for victims in court. Under s.1(1)(c) SOA 2003, the *mens rea* requirement changed. Honest belief in consent is not enough. The defendant's belief that the victim consents must be reasonable. This aspect of the fault element is now objective. Further, when s.75 or 76 applies such a belief will be presumed, conclusively or evidentially, **absent**. Otherwise, whether a belief in consent is reasonable is a matter for the jury. However, the trial judge may withdraw the issue from the jury if there is insufficient evidence. In *Ciccarelli*, the accused had sexually assaulted the complainant while she slept. The s.75 presumption applied that she did not consent as she was unconscious and this presumption was not rebutted. The accused's defence rested on the fact that while he knew the complainant was asleep, he believed she would have consented because of a sexual advance made by her to him earlier on the evening in question. The trial judge in that case addressed s.75 and ruled that whether or not the accused believed the victim was consenting, there was insufficient evidence that the accused's belief was reasonable. The judge said that she would direct the jury accordingly. As a result of this ruling, the accused changed his plea to guilty. He appealed against conviction on the ground that the judge's ruling was wrong and that the jury should have been allowed to consider whether his belief was reasonable. In dismissing the appeal the Lord Chief Justice said that the appellant's reasonable belief in the complainant's consent,

*either when she was asleep or in any other of the situations identified in section 75(2) (in what we describe as a position of disadvantage) will be considered by the jury provided that there is evidence which is sufficient to raise that issue.*

He agreed with the trial judge that there was no evidence upon which a reasonable person could possibly come to the conclusion that the victim would consent. The parties hardly knew each other and had never had any form of sexual contact.

Reasonableness has to be assessed, according to s.1(2) of the SOA 2003,

*having regard to all the circumstances including any steps [the defendant] has taken to ascertain whether [the person] consents.*

**page 105**
Whether a defendant's belief is reasonable or not is assessed objectively. It matters not that the defendant thought his belief was reasonable, if it was not. In *B* [2013] EWCA Crim 3 the defendant obliged his partner to have intercourse with him, having a delusion that he was a healer with special powers and that this would prevent his partner taking an improper interest in other men. The Court concluded that delusional beliefs such as he undoubtedly had would not in law render reasonable a belief that his partner was consenting when in fact she was not. A delusional belief in consent is, by definition, an unreasonable one.
