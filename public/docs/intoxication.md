Prof William Wilson Criminal law

## Learning objectives

- After completing this topic, you should be able to:
- Explain and understand the nature of failure of proof defences
- Explain and understand how providing evidence of intoxication can only ever be relevant to the question whether the accused formed the mens rea for the offence charged.
- Explain how intoxication is no answer to crimes which do not require proof of mens rea
- Explain the difference between voluntary and involuntary intoxication
- Explain how voluntary intoxication is relevant only with respect to crimes of basic intent
- Understand and explain the difference between crimes of specific intent and crimes of basic intent.

## Intoxication

- Is not a true defence but the defence may wish to raise evidence of intoxication to substantiate the claim that he did not form the *mens rea* for the offence.
- Intoxication is no answer to strict liability crimes or crimes of negligence as these do not require proof of mens rea. *R v Blakely and Sutton*
- If mens rea **is present** D is guilty **even though he would not have committed the offence if sober**

*Kingston*

• There are two categories of intoxication – voluntary and involuntary intoxication. The rules as to whether evidence of intoxication can be adduced to negate mens rea differ depending upon which category of intoxication the defendant experienced**.**

 • **Involuntary Intoxication**

- **A. Intoxicant taken under medical supervision**
- **B. Intoxicant secretly administered to A without his knowledge eg** *Kingston*
- **C. Intoxicant NOT take under medical supervision but which is not known to provoke erratic or unpredictable behaviour eg** *R v Hardie*

### Intoxication (Involuntary)

- **Case 1** Eve spikes Adam's soft drink with alcohol at a party. He is unaware of this. When it is time to go he goes into the kitchen for a glass of water. Having drunk it he misjudges the distance beween the glass and the sink because of his intoxication and the glass falls and breaks.
- **Case 2** Eve spikes Adam's soft drink with alcohol at a party. He is unaware of this. On the way home on his bicycle Adam is stopped by a police officer who suspects him of being drunk. He gets off his bicycle and, because he is drunk, becomes angry and punches the police officer.

• 'the intoxication of a person by an intoxicant which he takes otherwise than properly for a medicinal purpose (and according to medical instruction), knowing that it is or may be an intoxicant.' (*Majewski*)

### Crimes of Specific Intent

If D is **voluntarily** intoxicated his lack of *mens rea* is only taken into account for crimes where the prosecution have to show D **intended to do what he did and intended the consequences**. These are known as crimes of specific intent.

*Crimes of Specific Intent* 

- *Murder*
- *Attempt*
- *Theft*
- *Causing grievous bodily harm with intent*

### *DPP v Beard* [1920] AC 479

• House of Lords The appellant whilst intoxicated raped young girl and put his hand over her mouth to stop her from screaming. She died of suffocation. He was charged with murder. His conviction was quashed by the House of Lords

"Where a specific intent is an essential element in the offence, evidence of a state of drunkenness rendering the accused incapable of forming such an intent should be taken into consideration in order to determine whether he had in fact formed the intent necessary to constitute the particular crime. If he was so drunk that he was incapable of forming the intent required he could not be convicted of a crime which was committed only if the intent was proved. ... In a charge of murder based upon intention to kill or to do grievous bodily harm, if the jury are satisfied that the accused was, by reason of his drunken condition, incapable of forming the intent to kill or to do grievous bodily harm ... he cannot be convicted of murder. But nevertheless unlawful homicide has been committed by the accused, and consequently he is guilty of unlawful homicide without malice aforethought, and that is manslaughter" Lord Birkenhead

### Crimes of Basic Intent

- Evidence of voluntary intoxication cannot be adduced to negate the *mens rea* of any other crime as it is considered a reckless course of conduct. Such crimes are called basic intent crimes.
- A crime which can be committed by recklessness or negligence (*Caldwell*)
- Eg assault (*Majewski*), rape, manslaughter (*Lipman*), malicious wounding, criminal damage (*Caldwell*), dangerous driving

### Intoxication (Voluntary)

- Almost all crimes of specific intent have a basic intent counterpart. So if A escapes liability for the specific intent crime (eg murder) because he lacks the necessary intent he can still be guilty of the basic intent crime (manslaughter) where intent does not have to be shown. (*DPP v Beard)*
- Eg section 18 OAPA 1861 is a specific intent crime but section 20 OAPA is a basic intent crime.

### Intoxicated Mistakes

• Intoxicated Mistakes as to a defence, eg duress and self defence, cannot be relied upon even for crimes of specific intent. *O'Connor, O'Grady.*
