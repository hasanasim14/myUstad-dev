 Rape: The Elements
• Sexual Offences Act 2003

## Rape

- Prior to 2003 the crime of rape was not fit for purpose
- Prosecution had to prove:
  - 1. Absence of consent.
  - 2. A **knew** that V was not consenting or might not be consenting.
- This was a tough burden to discharge caused problems for victims in court.
- Morgan (1975)

### Rape: The new law

- The 2003 Act makes it easier to establish the offence.
- A. Consent has a statutory definition s.74
- B. The fault element is now objective. D's belief that V is consenting must be REASONABLE
- B The Act states that in certain circumstances consent is presumed absent and fault is presumed to be present. In those circumstances the prosecution do not have to prove D's liability. It is presumed. S.75, 76

### Rape – SOA 03 (s1)

The important changes are outlined in section 1 of the SOA 2003. Section 1 reads as follows:

- *1) A person (A) commits an offence if*
  - *a) he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with his penis,*
  - *b) B does not consent to the penetration, and*
  - *c) A does not reasonably believe that B consents.*
- *2. Whether a belief is reasonable is to be determined having regard to all the circumstances, including any steps A has taken to ascertain whether B consents.*
- *3. Sections 75 and 76 apply to an offence under this section.*

### Rape the Elements **A Actus reus**

The *actus reus* elements of rape are:

- i. penetration by the (man's) penis;
- ii. of the vagina, mouth or anus; and
- iii. an absence of consent. The rules relating to consent are also applicable to sections 4–7 and so will be dealt with in another mini lecture.

#### **1 (Penile) penetration**

Penetration has to be with the defendant's penis.

- *a) Penetration by the penis*
- b) Non consensual penetration by something other than the penis, eg finger, bottle, dildo is not rape but the separate offence of assault by penetration (section 2 SOA 2003)

#### **2. Penetration refers to any of these three areas**:

- i. Vagina: References to any parts of the body include 'references to a part surgically constructed"
- ii. Anus: Anal rape was first recognised in 1994 by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, which finally established that both men and women could be victims of rape.
- iii. Mouth

- *Rape constituted by failure to withdraw*
- Section 78 embodies the pre 2003 Act law by defining that penetration as 'a continuing act from entry to withdrawal', *R v Cooper and Schaub (1994) Crim LR 531*; *Kaitamaki (1985) AC 147 PC.*

#### **3. Absence of Consent**

Consent is defined in section 74 SOA 2003. In certain circumstances, eg penetration accompanied by violence and threats, it is presumed that the victim did not consent.

### Rape: The Mens Rea

- 1. Intention to penetrate the victim's vagina/anus/mouth.
- 2. Absence of reasonable belief in the victim's consent.

- **1. Intention to penetrate the victim's vagina/anus/mouth**
- *R. v Gabbai (Edward)*

- **2. Absence of reasonable belief in the victim's consent**
- *Ciccarelli* (2012)
- Where section 75 and section 76 apply it is presumed that the defendant did not have reasonable grounds for believing the victim was consenting.
