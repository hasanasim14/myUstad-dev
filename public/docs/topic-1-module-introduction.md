## 1.0 Induction video

**Dr. Laura Lammasniemi:** Hello, everyone. My name is Dr. Laura Lammasniemi. I am the convener of criminal law. I'm also the chief examiner for criminal law. When I'm not doing work with University of London, I'm Associate Professor of Criminal Law at University of Warwick, which is in the Midlands, in the middle of England. I have to say, much like Inderpal was saying about London, it's also incredibly rainy morning here in West Midlands. Seeing that some of you are joining us from far and wide, from Sunnylands in the Caribbean, and in Malaysia, and in Hong Kong. I'm a little bit jealous because I have not seen any glimpse of a sunshine in at least two weeks. I'm delighted to have this induction and it's really great to see so many of you joining and hearing from you.

In this induction, we'll talk through some general things, and I'll introduce you to the module, how we study this module, study skills. Then we'll have plenty of time for questions at the end. The chat is also always open, like Inderpal says, so you can put your questions in the chat. I have it open, I will see it. If I don't immediately respond, it doesn't mean that I forgot about you, it just might be that I will respond to it either a bit later or then at the end. I will just share my slides for this session now so we can get started. Hopefully, everyone can see the slides on the screen.

In short, I said we'll talk a little bit about what is criminal law, introduce it to the module and then we'll think about studying criminal law. We had a few questions in the forum and like I said, you will have all the opportunity today to ask me whatever you want to ask. In the forum, the questions were actually mainly about how do we study criminal law. We'll talk about that towards the end of this induction session. I'm going to start with a question for you. Before I even pose the question, I'm going to say you don't need to answer this. My question to you is, have you ever committed any crimes ever in your life? Did you commit some crimes this week? Maybe you committed some crimes already today. Perhaps not those of you for whom it's five o'clock in the morning because that would be quite early start. Just take a moment to think about, "Did I actually ever commit any crimes?" This is the same for those of you who are joining us today or those of you who might be listening to later on.

Perhaps you have done something serious, in which case, you certainly don't need to share it with us. Perhaps you maybe were running a little bit late last week somewhere and you were driving over the speed limit. Perhaps you were using those self-checkout machines in a supermarket and just conveniently forgot to scan one item or maybe you really wanted to watch a movie that wasn't available on streaming and you chose to download it.

I think when you really think about how do you live your life, most of us want to live an honest and good life. It's actually quite hard to go about our entire life without breaking any laws at all. This certainly includes myself.

When we think about criminal law, one of the things that I think differentiates it is that it's absolutely everywhere. When we think about our lives, we often think about criminal law as these really big things. We think about murder. We think about serious sexual violence. Actually, quite a lot of criminal law is quite ordinary and it regulates our daily life. It regulates the way we drive, the way we do our shopping, the browsing that we do. It's quite hard to live your life without actually ever breaking any laws at all. I think that's what distinguishes criminal law from some of the other models that you do. I know that some of you are doing maybe contract law as well, and contract law is also absolutely everywhere. I still think that there's something a little bit different about criminal law because so many aspects of our daily lives are regulated by criminal law in a way that we don't always realize. If you think about when you go into your car and you put your seatbelt on, you just do it automatically. You don't think, "Oh, I must put my seatbelt on because I will be breaking the law if I don't." Absolutely every single part of our life, the moment we leave our house or even the way that we live our lives in our own homes is actually regulated by criminal law.

Another thing that makes criminal law perhaps a little bit different from some of the other models that you might be doing is that there's references to criminal law absolutely everywhere. You cannot switch on your TV without seeing some references to criminal law at some point. You might be looking at the news in your phone or from the TV. You might be watching movies. You might be reading something. You might be listening to a podcast. Actually, what perhaps separates criminal law from other things is that there's also a sort of entertainment aspect to it.

Criminal law is fascinating. It fascinates people. It terrifies people. Which is why we have so much popular culture about it in a way that there isn't that much popular culture about contract law. Let me tell you. When we look at something like the news, for example, things that are actually individual tragedies such as loss of a life of a young person can often dominate news for quite a long period of time. As can moments of serious civil unrest like what UK experienced in August when there were riots up and down the country.

I suppose as a law student, it is then really important that you recognize what aspects is that you're seeing is that entertainment, and then what actually is the study of criminal law. As a student, it is your job to distinguish what is fact from what is the study of criminal law, which can be two different things. Particularly because quite a lot of what we see in the entertainment is from US, and we need to remember that US rules on criminal law and US practices, they can still be quite different from the rules and practices in England.

One of the things why I think that there's a lot of misconceptions about crime, and prevalence of crime, and the nature of crime is that we have so much exposure to it. Often you see reports of people saying things like, "Oh, criminal law is on the rise again," or "people are worried about rising crime or rising violent crime." Actually, statistically speaking, in England, crime has steadily been going down, serious crime in particular, but because we see so much of it, we assume that homicide is absolutely everywhere, whereas in reality, there's only about 700 homicides in UK a year. Obviously, that is 700 too many. I think that's a little bit less than what people would often assume.

Then the final thing I'll say before I move on to think about what then is criminal law is that studying this model can be quite difficult for anyone who has personal experiences, either of crime, or of criminal justice. The two are not the same. A lot of crime happens that never actually make it to criminal courts. If you have experiences on any side of criminal justice or express crime, it can be quite difficult to study this. It's good that you look after yourself as you're doing it.

It's also good to bear it in mind that when you're taking part in conversations like our induction today, or maybe one of the study days, or your studies in centres, please bear in mind that other people that you're interacting with might have quite different experiences of that criminal justice system or crime that probably was not all positive for them. That's enough about the fascination that the society and popular culture has with criminal law. Then really, I thought I'd spend a little bit of time thinking about what then actually is criminal law. What is this big body of law that is you're about to study for the next year ahead?

I've given you here a factual definition first, which says, "It is a body of rules that sets out the definitions of criminal offences and describes punishment." I actually got this definition from the Crown Prosecution Service's own website. It's a bit of a boring definition, I would say. Yes, of course, criminal law is body of rules that set out definition of what are crimes and what are punishments. It doesn't actually tell us that much about the nature of criminal law or why something is criminal at all. I've given you also another definition that I think is a little bit better. It's still not perfect, but I think it gets to a little bit further ahead in us thinking about what criminal law is. This definition says, "Criminal law is politically determined restriction on individual rights through the threats or the imposition of penal sanction." Yes, the words are a little bit fancier, maybe, but at the core of it, it starts to get us a little bit closer to what criminal law actually is.

What criminal law in essence, what it is, it is a set of restrictions on all of us. It tells us what we cannot do in order to participate in the society. It tells us if we break these rules, we can no longer take part in society. That's what criminal law is. It's these restrictions that tell us that if you see a phone on the table that is not yours, you cannot take that phone and put it on your table. It says, "If you're angry, you cannot just punch someone in the face." It puts a restriction that says, "You can't have sex with someone who doesn't want to have sex with you." At all the time what criminal law does, it puts a restriction on all of us at any given time so we cannot just freely go about and do whatever we might want to do. It does that because of a greater good. It does that in order to protect other people's property, to protect other people's parallel identity.

For me at the core of criminal law what makes it really interesting is that you have always this balancing exercise between putting these restrictions on individuals' autonomy and right to do whatever they want and then protecting the society on the other hand. That's a really difficult balance. It's a really difficult balance to find, that balance between restricting people, respecting their autonomy, and then protecting the society. Some laws get it right, some laws go a little bit too far either way, or one or the other way.

For me, this is what makes criminal law really fascinating. We have this big body of law which we call criminal law, which is this big attempt to keep society safe without putting too much restriction on individuals. That's your big body of criminal law. Then within this huge body of law, we have individual criminal offences. This is what we'll be studying on this model. We'll be studying these individual criminal offences. These criminal offences traditionally prohibit people from doing something, such as taking that phone that doesn't

belong to you or punching someone in the face. These offences can also include what they call omissions. Omission is a failure to act.

For example, a parent has a duty to feed their child. If they don't feed their child, the child starves to death, the parent is liable for failure to act. That's another type of criminal offence. Then sometimes criminal law also criminalizes results. It's not about the actions or the inactions, but it can also be about the result. Criminal damage is a good example of a result crime. For example, if you think about throwing a stone, it is not a criminal offence to throw a stone in the air. If you throw a stone in the air, and it breaks your neighbour's window, it becomes criminal damage and a criminal offence. You can have certain acts, you can have certain omissions, and you can have certain results that are criminalized when it comes to criminal law.

What combines all these unlawful acts, omissions, and results is that at some point the state thought these acts are so bad that we need to step in. [coughs] They thought that these acts are so bad that whatever the person did amounts to criminal offence. When we think about the overall nature of criminal law, we need to think about things that the state considers to be so bad that this is not just a civil wrong. I think some of you would be studying torts as well at the moment and thought is all about those civil wrongs. This is where tort and criminal law really differ from each other, is that when we talk about criminal law wrongs, we think about public wrongs. They're saying that whatever that person did is not just a violation against another individual, but it's also a violation against the state because in criminal law, it is the state that investigates. Police is a public body, they investigate. It is the state that prosecutes crimes. We have a crime prosecution service. It's also the state that punishes. It's the state that puts people in prison, administers fines and so on.

Whatever the person do in criminal law, we think is so bad that the state has to intervene here. Criminal wrongs, they are also public wrongs. You're not just offending the individual, but it is this idea that you're also offending the society. You're offending the community by breaking the rules and maybe stealing something. You are also offending against the state when you're harming people. A unique feature of English criminal law is that you're also offending against the monarch. This idea that when you kill a person, traditionally, you weren't just taking that person's lives, and it's not just the loved ones who are grieved, but you have also taken life of one of the king or queen's subjects.

If you look at the names of criminal cases, as you will start to study criminal law, you will find that criminal cases will always begin with RV, and then the name of the defendant. Here R stands for Rex or for Regina, which is the king or the queen at the moment, all criminal cases that are going through the Crown Court, all of them would be prosecuted as, "Rex against whoever is the defendant, because they are all prosecuted in the names of the king. That's quite a unique feature of English criminal law. This idea that when you're offending, it's not just an individual wrong, but it's actually something much bigger. It's a public wrong. Then I want to say a few words about where is it then that we focus within those criminal offences. Our jurisdiction is England and Wales. Sometimes you hear people talk about UK law, but when it comes to criminal law, there is no such a thing. UK consists of four nations. We have England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Scotland and Northern Ireland have quite devolved legal systems. Northern Ireland less so, but Scotland has a whole criminal law structure that is different from England. They have something called Sheriff Courts, they have their own criminal law. Scotland is entirely separate when it comes to criminal offences. What we study is the law of England and Wales. I think what comes as a surprise to those who are joining from-- we have people joining from Malaysia, for example. Countries where you might have a strong penal code, like Malaysia, India, Pakistan. England doesn't have such a thing. There is no book that I can go to and say, "Wow, this is an offence under this and this." No, this doesn't exist in England. There is no central penal code. Rather, criminal law is scattered around a patchwork of statutes and common law.

Common law is still a hugely important part of criminal law. Most criminal law still comes from common law. Traditionally, all criminal law was common law. It was all decided by judges in all cases. Then I would say from late 19th century onwards, you have more and more statutes, but even so, a lot of the big really important offences are still common law offences.

For example, when you will be studying murder, you will be going to the words of Sir Edward Coke. I've given you here on the screen a picture of Sir Edward Coke. When we look at definition of murder, we actually go to his words from a case that takes about 500 years ago. That's where we find our definition of murder, not in the statute books. Which makes studying criminal law a little bit difficult because you have such a big area, and so many centuries of law that you are covering. It also makes it fascinating, I think, in many ways.

Often students ask me, "Why do we need to study so many cases and why there are so many cases for every single topic? The reason why there are so many cases when it comes to criminal law is simply the fact that a lot of the criminal law still is those cases. When we ask you to read a particular case in causation, for example, we're not asking you to read it because it's a bit of extra, we're asking you to read it because that case actually is the law.

Legal precedents that you'll be studying in the legal matters course play a really really big part in criminal law as well. Someone had a specific question on cases and I'll answer that a little bit later when we go there. That's our jurisdiction. We're focusing on England and Wales. Then when we study those individual offences and defences, we have to look quite far and wide into both in terms of cases as well as in statute to know where those laws are coming from.

In this course, we can broadly define the syllabus in three. In the early part, everyone, when you'll be starting your studies, you are going to be starting from the basics of criminal liability, thinking about terms called actus reus and mens rea. All of these terms will become clear to you once you actually start the course. These are effectively the building blocks of criminal law. Before we move on to think about any specific offences and defences, we will then firstly, we'll spend a good amount of time really thinking about how do these offences and defences work. Once we know those building blocks, then we move on to think about specific crimes and specific offences and specific defences. We broadly cover first homicide, think about all forms of homicide offences. Then we think about nonfatal offences, including sexual offences and violent offences. Then we look at property offences or crimes against property.

Then in the final part, we'll be looking at defences as well. Then the third bundle, if you wish, that forms part of the syllabus is attempts and participation. This is then thinking about what about then those peoples who didn't do the killing, but they perhaps

contributed to it, maybe they helped, maybe they tried to do something, they didn't succeed. That's the final part of the course. I would say the causes are broadly divided in three. The building blocks, the specific offences, and then that extended liability that people might have.

We had a few questions here on this point, actually on Moodle, and there was a specific question that spoke about, how do you study criminal law? How do I learn the best? I've given you here a sort of step-by-step guidance on how to study criminal law. I would say the starting point for everyone should always be the Laws VLE. I know you all have access to it because you are here or because you're listening to this on the VLE, and that's always your starting point. What we have on the Laws VLE is this year more exercises than before, but also you have this snippet of summary of each of the areas that you need to study. It's a really accessible page or two, three pages of description of the key laws and how it all functions.

I would always, always start from there first. Once you have that basic information and knowledge there, then I would recommend you move to the textbook, which is here on the screen, and I also want to show you because I'm very happy about the textbook. This just came out this year. It's the eighth version, so there's an earlier version of this with a different cover, but this is a newer version that was published this year. It's by myself and William Wilson, who used to be the convener of the University of London model. You'll actually see William at some point still on the VLE. The textbook is written by myself and by William, but use it as your second step. Don't use it as your first step. The textbook is comprehensive. It starts often from the history. It gives you quite a lot of information. If you start from this, I think there's a chance that you feel a bit overwhelmed by the level of knowledge. I would strongly encourage you to start from the VLE first, then move on to the textbook, and then that will give you a really strong basis for your studies. We have a few questions on this point. Nico has his hand up, so we can have Nico's question, and then I have a question also on the chat, but let's go with Nico first.

**Nico:** Right. My question is I tried ordering this textbook, and as you said, it has been published this year, although I've been told by the bookstore that it still hasn't been published, and then they can only get it from the supplier in October, late October, early November. Can we also use maybe some earlier editions, or we should really use this eighth edition?

**Dr. Lammasniemi:** Yes, this is a good question. Yes, I know ordering can take a bit of time. You will have access to it, everyone will have access to it already through the online library. The online library has a e-version of the book, so everyone will be able to find it from the e-library, and you can read the latest edition online. If you prefer to have a physical copy, you can order your own version, or you can use an earlier version as well. The earlier version was on 2020, so there would have been some changes, so then I would recommend you read that book, but then just make sure that you read the online version to make sure that you're really up to date with all the changes that might have happened later on. Shin also had a question of, "Are all criminal law textbooks working in this course?" Effectively, yes, you can use other criminal law textbooks that are recent ones as well. The only thing I would say is that if you have a look at the VLE, you will see that there's quite a lot of tasks that require you to go to the book and read some sections, and it will be helpful to have this book alongside. Like I said, you don't need to actually get a physical copy of it. You do have access to it through the online library as an electronic

book. Melissa's question also was, "Is the seventh edition good?" Like I said to Nico, you can use the seventh edition, but then use the online library, and the eighth edition to make sure if there are changes in the law that you're up to date with everything that has happened.

No one needs to go and spend a lot of effort and time going find and buy the physical book because you do have access to it on the online version through the library. Yes, so in the order of things, start from the VLE, move on to textbook because textbooks always go in more detail, and there's quite a lot of information. Actually, all the information you might need is in the textbook. Then the next step because this question is specific on the Moodle was, oh, sorry, on the VLE was, how do I make that information retain? How do I retain that information? I think here it's really important to start to think about, how do I learn?

One of the really good ways of learning criminal law is creating flashcards of cases. You will be studying quite a few case law as you go along. Really think about how do I learn the best? I have an example for you coming on. Create some flashcard, create really good notes on each of the issues. As you have studied a topic in full, so you have read the VLE, you have read your textbook, you have really thought about the cases, then create good notes on each of the topic you have studied. I think this is really really crucial. Consolidate all of your theory and all of your topics in some notes that make sense to you at the end of all of this. When you are then embracing your revision comes in the March, April time, then you have notes ready, and it will make that period a lot easier for you.

We had another question on the chat. That was a question specifically think about what resources are helpful during that exam period? I would say your consolidated notes is the best thing to then go back on during that exam period. Then another really helpful material during the exam period is the past exams that you can access on the VLE, and the examiners reports. When it comes to that revision time, hopefully, you have done all your reading, you've done your consolidation, and then you start practicing answering the past questions.

Then we have a question from Chinedu in the chat that says, "Are students required to give full details of cases to support arguments during assessments and examinations?" Actually we had this question here on the forum as well. When you are reading the cases, always note of the case name and what is the most important thing about the case. You do not need to write down the year of the case or the citation of the case. Name of the case is good, but what is most important is the key principle from that case. Don't spend your time memorizing case years or citations because that's a waste of time. Just remember the name and the key ratio.

I just wanted to talk really quickly through thinking about these cases that you're going to study and how you're going to-- and this goes back to Chinedu's question as well. When you start to learn cases, it can be a little bit overwhelming to be like, "Oh, there's 10 cases on this particular topic. How do I make sense of it?" I think the most important way of making sense of all these cases is making notes for yourself, that make sense to you. One of the things that you will learn as a new student, is that you will learn not necessarily in the same way that your friends are learning. Maybe you're a mature student studying again, and you might find that, "Oh, actually, I don't take information in the same way today that I did 10 years ago." Think a little bit about how do you learn and what's best for you.

Bullying is a case that you will come across quite early in your studies. I've given you two different case notes here on the case of bullying. One is just a list of the information and another is a more visual one. When you start to think about, "How do I learn? Think about which one of these styles is more appealing to you, what you remember better. Maybe you like to have voice notes, and that could work better for you than actually written materials. Spend a little bit of time thinking about what is good for me, how do I learn? Most importantly, when you start to take notes from cases, always make sure that you have the full name of the case, and the citation so it's easy to find. Make sure you know briefly what the facts were about. Then the most important thing about cases is always that legal importance. Why was I asked to read this case? Make sure why this case is important. Then write down if there's anything that is really important for you to remember, like a test or a principle or judge's words. When you make notes on cases, if you have these brief details, the facts, the legal importance and why should I know this, you'll be absolutely good as gold come the revision period.

Make sure that you systematically build up these notes for yourself and it will be much easier than then try to do that later in the term. Then just the final thing about the assessment. The criminal law is assessed by a 100% exam. It is a timed exam. You will have a set amount of time to do this exam and you have to answer four questions in total. It is combination of problem questions and essay questions. Everyone has to answer one compulsory multi-part unseen problem question on a named topic area. The topic for this year is homicide. It's announced on the VLE, and everyone, hopefully, would have gotten that email. Everyone will have a problem question on the broad topic of homicide, and then they will have to answer a set of questions on that. There's a video that I made last year on how to answer these specific questions. Please have a look at that video as well. Then on the part two, you will answer a mixture of essays and problem questions. In some ways, it's quite a traditional exam. It will consist of hypothetical scenarios and of essay questions. You have to answer four questions in total. This is the last thing I will say, and then we'll open up to all of your questions that you might have.

I said that in the exams you need to answer essay questions and in problem questions. People will sometimes struggle with, well, what is the difference between two. In criminal law, we spend a lot of time with problem questions. You will see that there's a lot of hypothetical scenarios on the VLE, you will see there's a lot of hypothetical scenarios on the textbook, and there will be those hypothetical scenarios, those problem questions also in the exams.

The idea here is it's preparing you to think like a lawyer. The hypothetical scenarios are the scenarios that you could effectively come across when you are advising clients, or when you are working in law. It's just really asking you to know the law and apply the law. It's okay so you have studied all these things, you have all this knowledge of criminal law, how do you put that knowledge into practice? That's what problem questions are all about. It's preparing you to think like a lawyer, taking this legal information and putting in a problem question.

Then on the other hand, we also use essay questions. Essay questions are very different from problem questions. Essays is about that critical thinking, that critical analysis and this is a more academic mindset. It's saying, okay, so here's the law, is the law fair? Should the law be reformed? That's the nature of the essays. It's you're not asking to apply the law, you're asking to really think about it and think could the law be better for the people? Could the law be fairer? Would the law function somehow differently? That's what essay questions is all about.

In this course, we try to do both. We try to prepare you for that lawyer mindset where you apply the law to the scenarios that we're given, but on the other hand, we also want you to think about the law critically. To really think about is criminal law as good as it could be? Are there individual offences that should be reformed? Those are the two things that we're trying to get through throughout the year but then those are also the ways that you'll be assessed at the end of this year. Thank you very much and we have a first question from Nico.

**Nico:** Right, so I just have a question regarding the case names because when you were referring to a case, you only said the name of the defendant. What's the proper name when we are discussing a case or orally to refer to it?

**Dr. Lammasniemi:** Yes, so if the court records a case, it will always be R V and the name of the defendant. Then when you write about it or I write about it or when you read about it then we normally only go by the defendant's name. You don't always need to say R versus this but if you want to use the full name of the case, it will be normally R V and the defendant's name, so the state against the individual. When you write about it you can just use the surname of the defendant because that's how the courts will talk about these cases as well.

**Nico:** All right. Thank you.

**Dr. Lammasniemi:** Thank you. Do we have any other questions from anyone? Please go ahead.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I know you said not to worry too much about dates but I'm paranoid about them. [chuckles] Still I'm wondering in the assessment for the assay type questions, it's not a case where you're expected to say, " Hanna, (2009)" that sort of thing?

**Dr. Lammasniemi:** About the case names?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, like when you're doing your assessment, and you have the essay type questions.

**Dr. Lammasniemi:** No when you have the essay type questions any it doesn't matter really it's an essay type or problem type question. The most important thing about cases is always the legal principle about why is it important to read this case and that's the thing that you should really know and be able to discuss. For [coughs] cases, as long as the name which is the name of the defendant, that's fine. There might be some areas that if you think about where the order of cases is important. Say something happened in the '80s something happened in '90s something happened in 2000s, if you want to talk about the history, then it's obviously important what order in which the cases happened to trace that history, but you really don't need to spend time memorizing whether a case took place in 1999 or 1998. Spend your time on the really important things and understanding the case details and the legal principles that are coming from those cases.

**Speaker 1:** Thank you.

**Dr. Lammasniemi:** Thank you. That's the advice that I give the examiners as well. Do we have any other hands up? We have also hand up from Amna Buri, sorry, I'm mispronouncing.

**Speaker 2:** Arubina

**Dr. Lammasniemi:** Yes, thank you. Sorry for mispronouncing your name.

**Speaker 2:** It's totally fine. I just have a quick question please if I may.

**Dr. Lammasniemi:** Yes, please go ahead.

**Speaker 2:** Thank you. I have seen one of the exams questions, especially the problem question, and I've attempted to answer that question but then a question popped up in my mind, what if I want to have a review regarding my answer. Is there a place where I can just post my answer and then I get a review for it or there is no chance of that?

**Dr. Lammasniemi:** Yes, this is actually a great question. You can post in the VLE, there's number of what we call the sample exam questions or exam activities. Names are a little bit confusing. Effectively, they are the same things but there are past exam questions and you can write answers you can post them and then you can get feedback or you can hope that your colleagues maybe people attending here today, they'll also post and you can learn from others.

Then in the end of the year, we have something called Lecture Plus, which is the online lecture effectively. Then there will be a set of questions you can answer, you can post your answers in the chat, and I keep an eye on that forum, and you can get feedback that way. Then normally, we also run a formative assessment which is a little bit different, which is where you actually submit a draft answer, and then someone marks it. I think Inderpal would be in a better position to, if he knows where the formative assessments are, when they are but normally, at some point in the year where you can get individual feedback as well.

In addition to that individual feedback moment, the tasks on the VLE, they're set up in a way that you should be able to get feedback from your colleagues as you go along and other people are keeping an eye on the forum as well. Then you have a question from Judy about the tutorials and saying that she's also already studying at the centre and are you missing out anything by not attending the tutorials? This is a really is a good question as well, and I think it's something that everyone needs to decide for themselves. I think the idea of the tutorials is to give people the opportunity who don't have that regular interaction to have that interaction. We have a range of people, some people are studying in centres, some people are studying independently, some people are very happy with their studies in the centres, some people feel maybe they need a little bit extra. I think the assessment of whether or not you want to attend these tutorials is very much based on your personal circumstances. Feeling like, "Do you need that space where you want to discuss things in a group?" If you feel like you already have plenty of support and you feel like a really good quality teaching you might not benefit as much.

On the other hand, we have plenty of people attending who just don't have that regular opportunity to talk to their colleagues, to interact with a tutor and this is really the value of the tutorials. Is that if you feel like you want to engage with your other peers who are

studying the same things, you want to have those regular interactions with the tutor, then these tutorials can be a really really good way of getting that experience.

Do we have any other questions? Then I should also add on Robina's question about that she started to do this problem question and then felt maybe you can get a bit of feedback. I think it's really good habit to incorporate these past problem questions into your study and then always remember that you do have also the exam reports. We have on the VLE, you can find all past exam papers for the last five years I think and then there's also the examiner's report.

You can check your answers against the examiner's report to make sure you haven't missed out on anything crucial. If no one has any other questions, I'm going to let you get on with your day. I know it's a very early start for some of you so thank you for waking up at five o'clock and joining us. Even if you joined at a very convenient time for you, it was great to see you. Thank you very much for joining us.

## 1.1 What is criminal law?
Welcome to criminal law! I am Dr Laura Lammasniemi, the convenor of criminal law.

Before I say a few words about what criminal law is, I want to ask you a question. When I say the word 'criminal offence', what comes to your mind?

Perhaps you thought about murder or manslaughter. These are forms of unlawful killings that we see so much of in the news, sadly so. Perhaps you thought of violence, sexual violence, or even theft. These are all serious offences and these are offences that we will study together in this course. When we think about criminal law or read about criminal law in the news, it is often these serious crimes we think of. Yet, they are not the full extent of criminal law. Most criminal law is actually quite ordinary. Criminal law also consists of less serious regulatory offences. These regulatory offences regulate our daily lives in a way that we don't even often realise. These offences govern things like driving, parking, and safety at workplaces. They are important rules that ensure that society is run smoothly. These offences exist as a preventative measure, to prevent harm from happening in the future.

As important as these regulatory offences are, in this course, we will not really focus on them. We will focus more on those serious crimes such as murder, rape and causing grievous bodily harm. These serious offences are different from regulatory offences in many ways. One of the key differences is the reasons behind why they are criminalised. If you think of murder for example, we do not criminalise murder only to prevent harm from happening in the future. We criminalise murder to punish the offenders and to apportion blame for harm that has already happened.

Punishment is one of the key functions of criminal law. It is important to remember that it is not the only function of criminal law. Prevention of crime and maintaining social order are also very important functions of criminal law.

What then is criminal law? You might be wondering. In its very simplest or in its most basic form, we can define criminal law as a body of rules that set out the definitions of criminal offences and the rules and procedures that apply when the police investigate those offences. This is quite a boring definition though and it does not tell us much about the nature of criminal law or any of that thinking that underpins those rules that we will study.

Perhaps a better way to think about it is that at its very core, criminal law imposes restrictions on individual rights and on individual freedoms, through the threat or the imposition of penal sanctions. In other words criminal law tells us all what we can and cannot do. It tells us we cannot kill or steal, and if we break these rules we will be punished for it.

Although our focus on this course will be on substantive criminal law and it will be focusing on thinking about the elements of offences and defences, it's good to remember that none

of these offences or defences can be properly understood without due attention to the context in which they have been created in and they operate in. As you study different offences and defences you work through the topics on VLE, try to always ask yourself: Why and how is this particular conduct or activity criminalised?

Finally, I want to say a word about studying criminal law. All your key materials will be found on the Laws VLE, and you can use the textbook to supplement those studies. Some of the studies in criminal law might be little bit tough. There are some areas of criminal law that are complex or technical, and we will ask you to read many cases throughout the year. Too many cases, some students have said in the past. But do not be deterred. Studying criminal law is very rewarding too and you will learn a great deal about law, about punishment and even perhaps about human nature.

I hope you will enjoy the study of criminal law, and I wish you the best of luck with it.

The format and mode of assessment may need to change in light of extraordinary events beyond our control. In the event of any change, you will be informed of any changes to the assessment arrangements via the VLE.

The Criminal law assessment is divided into two parts.

- Part One (25% of the overall marks) is a compulsory multi-part unseen problem question on a named topic area. The topic area for both the April-June 2025 and October 2025 exam sessions is:
  - Criminal homicide: This topic includes murder, voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter.

The aim of this assessment exercise is to develop your skills in analysing a legal problem, identifying the points at issue, and outlining the possible arguments necessary to dispose of the case. You will be assessed on your competence on these matters as well as your knowledge of the relevant area of law. You must limit yourself to answering the questions posed succinctly, giving no extraneous information save in so far as it advances the point you are making.

• Part Two (75% of the overall marks) requires students to answer three out of six questions.

When studying the course, you will find it helpful to use **Past exam papers and reports** to generate the kind of questions that you may come across.

**Permitted materials**

During the assessment for this module, you are permitted to access the following:

• Blackstone's statutes on criminal law (Oxford University Press).
