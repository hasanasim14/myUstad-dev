# Failure of proof defences

What Kind of Defence is Intoxication? 
Professor William Wilson

## Learning objectives

At the end of this lecture you should be able

- To distinguish between voluntary and involuntary intoxication
- To understand how the nature of the intoxication may make a difference to the question of guilt.
- Understand that intoxication is not a defence in its own right but only a potentially useful piece of evidence for those denying *mensrea*
- Know the difference between crimes of specific intent and crimes of basic intent
- Understand why it might make a difference to the question of guilt if the offence charged is a crime of specific intent rather than one of basic intent

## General defences

Defences --> Failure of proof --> Automatism, Insanity, Intoxication, Consent, Mistake
       |---> Defenses of reasonable Action --> Duress, Necessity, Self Defence

## Illustration

A man went on an LSD trip with his girlfriend. In the course of this trip he hallucinated that she was a snake trying to bite him. He stuffed a sheet in her mouth, she died of suffocation. *Lipman* (1968)

## Illustration

• If Lipman is permitted to adduce evidence that he was hallucinating due to LSD, which caused him to make this mistake, the jury will acquit of murder for lack of *mens rea*.

Voluntary Involuntary
• The defence of intoxication specifies the circumstances under which the defendant is permitted to adduce evidence of intoxication to negate *mens rea* and the consequences which will follow.


## Involuntary

### 1. Involuntary intoxication

- If D is involuntarily intoxicated he is not guilty of **any** crime of *mensrea* if, by reason of the intoxication**, he failed to form mens rea** (ie any intention or foresight required by the crime definition)
- D will remain liable for crimes of strict liability or negligence even though he would not have committed the crimes if sober. *R v Blakely and Sutton.*
- D will also be liable if the effect of the intoxication is to disinhibit him rather than prevent him from forming *mensrea. R v Kingston (1995)*

### 2. Voluntary intoxication

If D is **voluntarily** intoxicated he will **not** be allowed to use this to support a claim that he lacked *mensrea* unless the crime is one, like murder, where the prosecution have to show D specifically **intended to do what he did and intended the consequences**. These are known as crimes of specific intent.

#### **Crimes of Specific Intent**

• *Murder* • *Attempt* • *Theft* • *Causing grievous bodily harm with intent*


## Intoxiaction
 **What is a Crime of Basic Intent?**

A crime which does not require proof that D intended any specific outcome of his action. It can be committed by recklessness or negligence (*Caldwell*)

- Eg assault, *Majewski (1993)*
- rape, *Beard* 1920
- manslaughter *Lipman (1968)*
- malicious wounding,
- criminal damage (Caldwell)
- dangerous driving

 **Prosecuting where the Defence pleads intoxication**

• Almost all specific intent crimes have a basic intent counterpart. If the evidence shows that D was voluntarily intoxicated at the time of committing the offence the prosecution will charge the crime of basic intent.

**Voluntary intoxication: (Study Guide 9.11.B)**

As a defence can only be used in connection with small class of 'crimes of specific intent'

'the intoxication of a person by an intoxicant which he takes otherwise than properly for a medicinal purpose (and according to medical instruction), knowing that it is or may be an intoxicant.' (Majewski)

**Involuntary Intoxication (Study Guide 9.11.B)**

- A. Intoxicant taken under medical supervision
- B. Intoxicant secretly administered to A without his knowledge eg *Kingston*
- C. An intoxicant taken by A which A believed to be innocuous, eg taking a psychoactive drug, believing it to be aspirin or other pain relief
- D. Intoxicant NOT taken under medical supervision but which is not known to provoke erratic or unpredictable behaviour eg R v Hardie.

**Case Study**

• Adam, a placid man, does not drink alcohol. Cain is a practical joker. He secretly adds vodka to Adam's orange juice at a party to see what Adam is like when drunk. Adam, who is unused to alcohol, feels strange and starts to act in a silly fashion. Cain taunts him for being drunk. Adam is indignant, loses his temper and punches Cain.

Is Adam guilty of assaulting Cain? Should he be?
