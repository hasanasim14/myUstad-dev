## Mini lecture 1 -  FORMS OF NON FATAL OFFENCES: COMMON ASSAULT 
Prof William Wilson

The forms of non-fatal offenses. This mini-lecture looks at the forms of non-fatal offenses. It concentrates on the second form, namely crimes against autonomy.

The first form of non-fatal offenses are the crimes of violence. The key thing to note about this category of offenses is that what is prohibited is the causing of harm, because the underlying premise of this form is that hurting people is wrong. The fact that the victim may have consented is irrelevant to the proof of guilt. So, it is no defense to having a puncher up to settle an argument that both parties consented if either of the parties suffer harm.

The offenses in the 1861 Act form a ladder of seriousness. At the bottom of the ladder is Section 47, assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Actual bodily harm means any harm above the trivial. On the next rung of the ladder is Section 20, malicious wounding. This requires proof of a wound or of serious harm. For Section 18, a wound or serious harm is also necessary. It is the top of the ladder because a specific intention to cause that injury must be proven.

The other category of non-fatal offenses are the crimes against autonomy. Instances include assault, battery, false imprisonment, and rape. These are crimes which are constituted irrespective of whether physical harm is suffered by the victim. What makes the accused act wrongful is that he did something to the victim that the victim did not consent to. For example, she locked him in a room, or he scraped her head, or she threw water at him or tickled him. All of these acts can be lawful, but only if they're consented to. If they're consented to, the victim is not wronged.

We will look at crimes against autonomy in this mini-lecture concentrating on assault and battery. Either form is an offense. Assault means to threaten someone with force. Battery means to apply force to someone or to make physical contact with them. If you punch someone, you commit a battery. If you threaten them with a punch, you commit an assault. Usually, an assault will accompany a battery, but it is possible for there to be a battery without an assault, for example, if you hit someone from behind. Simply there can be an assault without a battery, for example, if you threaten someone without actually laying hands on them.

Let's look first at assault. The Actus Reus of assault is acting so as to lead the victim to expect immediate unlawful force. Put another way, assault involves some form of threatening behavior. Some well-known examples from the caseload appear on this line. For example, pointing a gun at someone, rolling up one's sleeves, putting one's hand on one's sword, making as if to kiss someone, staring through a window, making a threatening phone call.

Battery does not require the victim to suffer any harm. It requires simply unwanted personal contact. Moreover, that contact must be in the form of force. In *Walkden*, it was held not to be a battery to drug, poison, or gas the victim because no force was used. These are offenses, but they are offenses under Section 23, the Offenses against the Person Act.

The men's rea of common assault is intention or recklessness. For battery, intending or foreseeing that one's unlawful act will result in physical contact with V. Assault, it's intending or foreseeing that one's unlawful act will cause V to fear suffering unlawful force.

D does not commit the offense if they believe their conduct to be lawful. So, a person who thinks they're being unlawfully attacked is not guilty of assault if they use force to resist a supposed attack, even if they're mistaken since they lack fault. In *R v William*, D punched a police officer under the mistaken belief the officer was a member of the public engaged in an unlawful attack. His conviction for assault was quashed as he believed his action to be lawful. It is also a defense that A believed V to be consenting to the use of force. Again, this is true even if A was mistaken and V did not consent.

In *Lau Shing Chung*, the appellant was convicted of one count of common assault. At trial, the appellant admitted that he had struck and shook the victim Yao. His defense was that he honestly believed Ms. Yao consented to his use of force as he was seeking to rid her of a ghost that he believed possessed her at the time, and she previously permitted him to use force on her when she acted as if she were possessed. The Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong held that there was evidence that the appellant honestly believed that Ms. Yao consented to his use of force. The conviction was therefore quashed for lack of fault.

## Introduction

Non-fatal offences against the person take two forms. The first, and most obvious, form involves crimes of violence. The criminal wrongdoing for such crimes is the causing of physical harm to another. Proof of physical harm is, therefore, an essential ingredient of these offences and, equally importantly, the offences may be committed irrespective of the victim's consent. The state takes the view that causing people physical harm is inherently wrong and, with some obvious exceptions such as surgery, the consent of the victim does not make it right.

The second form involves crimes against autonomy. The criminal wrongdoing for such crimes is the undesired interference with the victim's autonomy or freedom of action. The essence of these crimes is that the victim is interfered with against their will, rather than any harm which may have resulted. So, for example, if A (an adult) kisses B (another adult), this will be an offence only if B does not consent to the kiss. However, If A (an adult) punches B (another adult) in the course of an informal fight, **breaking B's nose**, this will be an offence even though B does consent to the punch, since physical harm has occurred which, as we shall see, cannot generally be consented to.

## 9.1 Crimes against autonomy: common assault

We shall start with crimes against autonomy. Autonomy means freedom to control one's own life, body and actions. The most common criminal interferences with autonomy include common assault, false imprisonment and rape. In this topic, we shall examine only common assault.

Common assault comprises two separate offences: assault and battery (also known as assault by beating). The difference between the two is simple. Battery (assault by beating) involves an unconsented-to application of force; assault (simple assault) involves the unconsummated threat thereof. Punching someone is a battery; threatening to do so is an assault. Usually, both offences will be committed at the same time (e.g. by A threatening to hit B before they deliver the blow). It is possible, however, for the offences to be committed singly (e.g. by threatening to hit someone without consummating the threat or by hitting someone from behind).

Failure to charge the right offence will result in the case being thrown out (R (Kracher) v Leicester Magistrates' Court (2013)).

Assault and battery are offences in their own right as well as being ingredients in other offences, such as assault occasioning actual bodily harm and assault with intent to rob. They were originally common law offences but were made statutory offences by s.39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. The principles governing the offences are. however, still to be found in case law. This includes both the criminal law and the law of tort (trespass to the person). They are triable only summarily with a maximum sentence of six months' imprisonment.

Do not allow yourself to be confused over terminology. The phrase 'common assault' refers to both assault and battery. So to say 'A assaulted B' can mean either that A hit B or that A threatened to hit B. However, it is always best to identify the type of common assault you are dealing with for purposes of clarity. You may wish to follow the lead of Glanville Williams (Textbook of Criminal Law. (London: Stevens & Sons, 1983) second edition [ISBN 9780420468604]), who distinguishes the two forms by referring to battery (assault by beating) as 'physical assault' and assault as 'psychic' assault.

### 9.1.1 Assault

The first form of common assault is assault, properly so called, or - as Williams calls it

- 'psychic' assault, or simple assault. It requires no physical contact with the person of the victim. It was defined in Venna [1975] 3 All ER 788 as follows:

A person is guilty of assault if he intentionally or recklessly leads someone to apprehend the application to his body of immediate unlawful force.

Actus reus: assault

Causing apprehension

The actus reus of simple assault is acting so as to lead another to apprehend an immediate unlawful contact. To apprehend means simply to 'expect'. It does not specifically require 'fear', although fear will normally be present (Savage and Parmenter, the House of Lords approving Venna).

#### **Study task 1**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 11.3.A.1 'Assault' and answer the following questions.

- a. A points a gun at B and threatens to shoot B. B, but not A, knows the gun is not loaded. Is there an assault?
- b. A points a gun at B and threatens to shoot B. A, but not B, knows the gun is not loaded. Is there an assault?

Show feedback

- a. No. There is an attempted assault though.
- b. Yes.

#### Immediacy

The definition refers to the apprehension of 'immediate force'. This formerly meant that some form of physical confrontation was necessary. For this reason, it was not an assault if D threatened V with future harm (Halliday), or threatened V from afar, or otherwise was unable to put their threat into immediate execution. So, in Thomas v NUM [1986], a civil case, it was not an assault when picketing mineworkers made threatening gestures to strikebreaking colleagues who were travelling to the colliery by bus under police escort, as there was no immediate prospect of converting the threat into action. It would have been different if the picketing miners had thrown stones or produced guns, since this would create an apprehension of immediate danger.

In recent years, this requirement of immediacy has been gradually attenuated, largely on the ground that the wrongdoing component of an assault is the effect the threat has on the victim rather than the reasonableness of the victim's fear. Fear, after all, often produces irrational thoughts, So. in Smith y Chief Constable of Woking (1983) 76 Cr App R 234, D, late one night, peered through the curtains of V's apartment. This frightened V considerably

and she called the police. D argued that he was not guilty of an assault, as he had done nothing which would put V in fear of immediate personal violence. This argument was rejected on the basis that D's action was likely to instil fear of potential violence, even though objectively his position outside the apartment made this physically impossible. Kerr LJ said:

What else, other than some form of immediate violence, could [V] have been terrified about?... When one is in a state of terror one is very often unable to analyse precisely what one is frightened of as likely to happen next. When I say that, I am speaking of a situation such as the present, where the person who causes one to be terrified is immediately adjacent, albeit on the other side of a window...It was clearly a situation where the basis of the fear which was instilled in her was that she did not know what the defendant was going to do next, but that, whatever he might be going to do next, and sufficiently immediately for the purposes of the offence, was something of a violent nature.

This kind of behaviour is now a separate statutory offence under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. But the effect of the case has been to change the application of the law in cases such as Thomas v NUM. The leading authority on the matter is *Ireland* [1998] AC 147. In this case, D made a number of phone calls to V; some included threats, others were silent. The House of Lords concluded, consistently with Smith v Woking, that the ingredients of assault were present, whether or not words were used, so long as the jury was convinced that D's phone calls led V to expect immediate personal violence, and this did not require a face-to-face confrontation between D and V. Another important consequence of this case is to rid the law of any doubt that assault could not be committed by words alone. It can. Indeed, even a silent telephone call is an assault if it leads V to apprehend immediate personal violence.

The effect of this House of Lords' decision is to relax the immediacy requirement quite considerably. In Constanza [1997] 2 Cr App R 492, the Court of Appeal held that even sending threatening letters could form the subject matter of an assault. On the question of immediacy, it sufficed that D's actions provoked a fear of violence at some time, not excluding the immediate future.

#### **Study task 2**

Read the following scenario:

Eve is an asthmatic. Adam, who knows this, steals her inhaler. He then telephones her to tell her what he has done. Eve asks for its return but Adam refuses, although he foresees that this might cause her to have a panic attack which in turn would precipitate an asthma attack. This is indeed what happens and Eve is

rushed to hospital. In attempting to remedy her condition an overdose of a palliative drug is given which sends Eve into a coma. She regains consciousness a few days later with no ill effects.

Explain why Adam was not guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

#### Unlawful force

The force or threat of force must be unlawful, so no offence is committed if D is acting in self-defence, or if the show of force was done to effect a lawful arrest (s.3(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1967 (CLA 1967)) or the approach is consented to. So in Cousins [1982] 2 All ER 115, it was said that a threat to kill was capable of being a lawful exercise of self-defence in discouraging a threatened attack and so would not be an assault. This is also the case if A permits B (a circus knife-thrower) to throw a knife at her, which he does: no assault is committed due to A's consent, even though A apprehends the possibility of being struck.

#### Mens rea: assault

The mens rea for common assault of this kind is intention or common law recklessness: that is, foresight that V will apprehend the application of unlawful force. In Spratt [1990] 1 WLR 1073, D fired an air pistol through the window of his apartment for no particular reason. Two pellets hit a girl playing in the forecourt, whom D had not known was there. D was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm (s.47 OAPA). The Court of Appeal quashed his conviction. To be guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm the prosecution had to prove **both** the bodily harm and an assault that had caused it. It could prove the former but not the latter, since to be quilty of an assault it had to be proven that D intended to hit the girl (battery) or cause her to fear being hit (assault), or foresight of either of these alternatives. It could only prove such intention or foresight if D had known the girl was there.

### 9.1.2 Battery or assault by beating

Battery can be defined as:

any act by which D, intentionally or recklessly, inflicts (non-consensual) unlawful force upon P.

#### Actus reus: battery Force

As has been explained, the wrongdoing in common assault, including battery (otherwise known as 'assault by beating'), is not the causing of physical harm, but causing unwanted interference with the person of the victim, whether or not physical harm is caused. In battery, this takes the form of someone applying force to the victim, or  $$ putting it another way – making physical contact with them. So examples of battery include restraining a person

(Collins v Wilcock [1984] 1 WLR 1172), digging them in the ribs, spitting on them (Commonwealth v Cohen 55 Mass App Ct 358 (2002)), cutting their hair (DPP v Smith (2006)), even, it appears, cutting or feeling a person's clothes while those clothes are on their person (Day (1845) 1 Cox CC 207).

The physical contact does not have to be painful or hurt, but it does have to involve force. So it is not battery to drug, poison or gas someone, as this does not involve physical contact: such interferences should be charged as an offence under s.23 OAPA.

A battery requires an act. In other words, it may not be committed by omission. So a tree surgeon who, without fault, allows a tree branch to fall, pinning a passer-by to the ground, does not commit battery by failing to remove the branch. One qualification to this rule is the continuing act doctrine. This refers to cases where the defendant's failure to act can be construed as continuing an earlier act. In Fagan v MPC [1968] 3 All ER 442, it was an assault for a driver to fail to remove his car from a policeman's foot, having first parked it there without fault. The court ruled that this was not an omission but a continuation of the initial act of parking. Put another way, F was not 'omitting'

to remove the car from the foot. He was 'keeping' the car on the foot just as he would have been doing if, having stepped on the policeman's foot by mistake, he then refused to step off again. The requirement that there be an act was reaffirmed in *Dunn* (2015), which was considered in Topic 3 of this module guide.

#### **Study task 3**

If Fagan had only learned about the plight of the policeman having left the car, would his refusal to remove the car still be a continuation of the initial act of parking the car?

**Show feedback**

Don't see why not. Adam will have to remove the car at some time and his refusal is still the act of 'keeping' the car on the police officer's foot.

#### Is direct contact necessary?

It is not necessary for there to be direct contact between D and V. In the old case of Martin, it was a battery for a practical joker to shout 'Fire!' at a theatre production, resulting in injuries to members of the audience trapped in the resulting crush (Martin (1881) 8 QBD 54). In Haystead v DPP [2000] 3 All ER 690, the defendant punched a woman, which caused her to drop her baby on the ground. The Court of Appeal confirmed that a battery was

effected against **both** the mother and the baby. Battery did not require the force suffered by the victim to be directly inflicted. In the case of the mother, the battery was intentional. In the case of the baby, it was reckless. Both fault elements suffice for battery.

So also in Mitchell [1983] 2 All ER 427, D assaulted V by pushing T roughly, who then fell on top of V. The case of DPP v K (A Minor) (1990) 91 Cr App R 23 is a more troublesome case. K, a schoolboy, loaded a hand dryer in the school lavatories with acid. The next user, V, was injured when it discharged on to him. The Queen's Bench Division was satisfied that this was a battery. But what force did K apply directly or indirectly to V? Presumably, the force of the acid hitting his person.

#### Unlawful force

The force or threat of force must be unlawful; therefore, as with assault, no offence is committed if D is acting in self-defence, or the contact is consented to (Slingsby [1995] Crim LR 570) or if the show of force was done to effect a lawful arrest (s.3(1) CLA 1967). In Kenlin v Gardiner [1966] 3 All ER 931, police officers were suspicious of the activities of two boys and took hold of them to prevent them running away. They struggled and punched the officers. The boys appealed against their convictions for assault at the Magistrates' Court. The Queen's Bench Divisional Court held that, since the boys were not arrested, the taking hold of them was an assault by the officers. The boys were allowed to use reasonable force in self-defence against an assault, and their convictions were quashed.

Compare this case with Donnelly v Jackman [1970] 1 All ER 987, 134 JP 352, where, on similar facts, the officer tapped D on the shoulder with the intention of stopping him. D then punched the officer. On appeal against conviction, the Divisional Court upheld D's conviction. Tapping D on the shoulder was a trivial interference with his autonomy and did not take the officer outside the exercise of his duty. This case shows that not every unconsented-to contact is a battery. Unconsented-to contacts issuing from the ordinary rough and tumble of everyday life do not count as batteries so long as the force used was not excessive (Collins v Wilcock [1984] 1 WLR 1172). This will include such contacts as taps on the shoulder to attract another's attention, slaps on the back in greeting, jostling, knocking and bumping in gueues, on trains and while running for the bus.

However, contrary to some earlier authorities, there is no requirement that the touching be hostile. If V makes clear that they refuse a particular kind of contact, D will commit battery if they ignore the refusal, however well intentioned. A surgeon who discovers cancer in the womb of an anaesthetised woman on whom he is a performing a dilation and curettage acts unlawfully if, without gaining the woman's consent, he performs a hysterectomy. Mens rea: battery

The mens rea for battery, as with assault, is intention and recklessness as to the unlawful contact. It is not intention or recklessness as to any resulting harm. It is for this reason that in Slingsby (1995) (Slingsby caused the death of his partner as a result of penetrating her anus with his fist, which was done with her consent) D was not guilty of manslaughter, because, although he may have foreseen some injury to his partner, he did not have the mens rea for battery. The actus reus of battery is the application of unconsented-to force: the mens rea is the intention to apply (or foresight regarding) unconsented-to force.

### 9.1.3 Charging common assault

We have seen that actual physical harm is not of the essence of battery. However, most cases of battery will inevitably result in some physical harm. The question for the prosecuting authorities is, therefore, whether to charge such a case as common assault or the aggravated version, assault occasioning actual bodily harm (s.47) OAPA). The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has published charging standards for the guidance of prosecutors. These state that batteries causing minor bruises and cuts, abrasions, swellings, broken nose, loss or breaking of teeth and black eyes are appropriately charged as common assaults. More serious injuries, such as also appear in the charging standards, are chargeable under s.47 and s.20 OAPA. The charging standards do not have the force of law but do help to explain why cases are charged as they are. Why do you think a prosecutor may 'undercharge' in this way?

## 9.2 Crimes of violence

The crimes of violence dealt with in this module guide are those appearing in the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 (OAPA). These offences form a ladder of relative seriousness starting from, at the bottom of the ladder, assault occasioning bodily harm (s.47), to malicious wounding (s.20), up to wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (GBH) (s.18). We shall deal with these in ascending order of gravity, starting with the least serious.

9.2.1 Assault occasioning actual bodily harm

Section 47 OAPA makes it an offence to commit an assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

### Actus reus: s 47

To support a conviction for s.47 the prosecution must therefore establish:

- a common assault
- actual bodily harm
- a causal connection (occasioning) between the assault and the harm.

### Common assault

The elements of common assault have been dealt with above. You will remember that an assault comprises two alternative forms of wrongdoing. The first is an unconsummated threat of unlawful force to another person ('psychic' or 'simple' assault). The second is the actual application of unlawful force to the body of another. This is known as a battery, assault by beating or 'physical' assault. The prosecution can establish the s.47 offence, therefore, if it can prove actual bodily harm was caused as a result of D either threatening an unlawful contact or actually making such contact.

### **Illustration 1**

A punches B (battery), breaking B's nose (causing actual bodily harm).

- a. A, intending to throw beer at V, accidentally lets go of the glass (causing), which hits (battery) and cuts C (actual bodily harm) (Savage [1992] 1 AC 699).
- b. A makes an unwelcome advance to  $V$ , a passenger in the back of B's car (simple assault).

V, in fear, jumps out of the car, breaking her leg (causing actual bodily harm) (Roberts (1972) 56 Cr App R 95).

### Actual bodily harm

Actual bodily harm was defined rather loosely by Swift J in Donovan [1934] 2 KB 498 as:

any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the [victim]. Such hurt or injury need not be permanent but must...be more than merely transient and trifling.

The jury is the arbiter of fact as to whether the 'hurt' suffered by V is 'actual bodily harm'. Any injury which is not trivial is theoretically 'bodily harm'. In practice, s.47 is unlikely to be charged unless the degree of injury is fairly substantial. Assaults causing minor scratches and bruises tend to be charged as common assault. Actual bodily harm does not, however, require injury to living tissue. The Divisional Court has included the cutting of a woman's ponytail as actual bodily harm, although the hair is technically 'dead tissue' (DPP v Smith [2006] EWHC 94  $(Admin)$ ).

Actual bodily harm has been defined to include psychiatric injury. In Chan Fook [1994] 1 WLR 689, the Court of Appeal ruled that this did not include simply shock, pain or panic; a recognised psychiatric illness is necessary. In Ireland and Burstow, two women who suffered panic disorder (chronic panic attacks) and depressive illness as a result of being persistently stalked by the defendants were ruled to have suffered 'bodily' harm for the purposes of both s.47 and s.20. *Ireland* (see below) is authority for two separate propositions:

- a telephone call, even a silent telephone call, can constitute a common assault
- if psychiatric injury is suffered as a result, the assault can be charged as assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

If the psychiatric injury suffered is severe, the assault can be charged, under s.20 OAPA, as the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm. See Burstow, below.

### The causal connection

Section 47 refers to assault 'occasioning' actual bodily harm. 'Occasioning' simply means 'causing'. To secure a conviction for s.47, as opposed to common assault, therefore, the prosecution must prove an unbroken causal chain linking the victim's injury with the defendant's assault (or battery). The test for causation requires simply that the defendant's actions were a factual and legal cause of the common assault. The factual cause will be the legal cause if it substantially contributed to the resulting harm and if there was no novus actus interveniens (see Topic  $4).$ 

In the leading case of Roberts (1972) 56 Cr App R 95, D touched V on the knee. Fearing a sexual attack, V jumped out of the car. Was D guilty of a common assault only or of the s.47 offence?

D argued that he should not be guilty of the aggravated offence, only the common assault, because he did not cause the victim's injury; she did, by jumping out of the car. The court ruled that, even if her reaction was not foreseen, since her reaction was reasonably foreseeable - that is, not abnormal - the causal chain linking assault and physical harm remained intact. Roberts was approved in Savage [1992] 1 AC 699, in which the House of Lords stated:

The verdict of assault occasioning actual bodily harm may be returned upon proof of an assault together with proof of the fact that actual bodily harm was occasioned by the assault.

### Mens rea: s.47

The *mens rea* for s.47 requires, therefore, only an intention to cause apprehension of physical contact or an intention to apply (unlawful) force to the victim (or foresight of either). It is not necessary to prove D intended or foresaw the injury. Therefore, in Roberts, it was not necessary for the prosecution to prove that D foresaw any injury, as long as he intended to make physical contact with V or foresaw her apprehension thereof. Proving culpability requires proof of foresight, proving cause does not. Again, in Savage, where V was injured by a beer glass, the offence was made out upon proof that D intended to throw beer at V. It was not necessary to show further any foresight that the beer glass might slip from her grasp and cause the resulting cut.

### **Study task 4**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Sections 11.3 'Offences protecting personal autonomy' and 11.4 'Crimes of violence' and answer the following questions.

- a. Adam and Eve are partners. One day Eve starts tickling Adam. He asks her to stop but she refuses and so Adam jumps over the sofa and falls awkwardly, breaking his ankle. Has Eve committed assault occasioning actual bodily harm?
- b. Eve is an asthmatic. Adam, who knows this, steals her inhaler. He then telephones her to tell her what he has done. Eve asks for its return but Adam refuses, although he foresees that this might cause her to have a panic attack which in turn would precipitate an asthma attack. This is indeed what happens and Eve is rushed to hospital. In attempting to remedy her condition an overdose of a palliative drug is given which sends Eve into a coma. She regains consciousness a few days later with no ill effects. What offence(s), if any, has Adam committed?

Tip (2), Adam cannot be guilty under s.47. Do you know why? If you do, and you understand what he may be guilty of, you are a long way down the road to a good understanding of this area.

- a. The issues are twofold. Has Eve assaulted Adam? This depends upon whether Adam is deemed to consent to 'play tickling', although he has asked her to stop. This is a matter for the jury. The second issue is whether, assuming consent is not present, Eve's battery on Adam causes him ABH. It looks like it has. There is no break in the chain of causation here. Everything follows naturally on from the tickling. b. There are two possible offences here, s.47 and s 20. Section 18 is not relevant as there is no evidence
  - of a specific intention to cause Eve GBH.
    - Section 47: All the elements are clearly present except one. There is ABH (asthma and coma). The ABH has been caused by Adam's act. The issue is whether Adam's act - the telephone call - is an assault. You may be thinking that it is, due to the effect of Ireland. You would be wrong! All Ireland says is that a person can commit assault by telephone. It does not say that causing someone harm by telephone is an assault. A telephone call is only an assault if it leads the victim to expect an undesired physical contact. This telephone call did not do this. It frightened Eve, but her fright was not due to fearing violence.
    - Section 20: This is much more likely. GBH (the coma) has been suffered. Following Burstow there is little doubt that Adam will be held to have 'inflicted' this on Eve because 'inflict' simply means 'cause'. Adam has caused her asthma attack and her coma because nothing has happened out of the ordinary to break the chain of causation. Can Adam escape liability on the ground that he did not foresee GBH (the coma)? No, because Mowatt requires proof only that he did foresee some harm befalling Eve, albeit not harm of the gravity actually occurring (see Section 9.2.2). If you read the facts, he clearly did.

### 9.2.2 Malicious wounding/infliction of grievous bodily harm

Malicious wounding is on the next rung up in the hierarchy of gravity. Under s.20 of the OAPA, an offence is committed where D:

unlawfully and maliciously wound[s] or inflict[s] any grievous bodily harm upon any other person, either with or without any weapon or instrument.

#### Actus reus: s.20

It is important to understand that there are two different conduct elements in s.20 (and s.18). The first is a wounding; the second is inflicting (or causing) grievous bodily harm. These are by no means synonymous. It is possible to wound someone without them suffering grievous bodily harm. And it is possible to inflict grievous bodily harm on someone without wounding them. It is key to your proper understanding of this offence and s.20 below that you understand and remember this point.

#### **Illustration 2**

- a. D, wanting to hurt V, stabs him in the leg with a small screwdriver. The screwdriver punctures V's leg and causes significant bleeding.
- b. D, wanting to daze V so as to make his escape, hits him over the head with a baseball bat. This causes a fracture to V's skull.

Both these cases support a conviction under s.20. In the first case there is a wounding without grievous bodily harm, whereas in the second there is an infliction of grievous bodily harm but no wounding. In practice, trivial wounds such as Illustration 2a tend to be charged under s.47 in the absence of an intention to cause serious injury.

The way this offence has been fashioned, therefore, encompasses an enormous potential range of degrees of injury, from a trivial wound to a life-endangering beating. Both are subject to the same maximum punishment of five years. In the next two sections, we will examine what is meant by a wounding and what is meant by grievous bodily, together with their points of overlap and difference.

#### Wounding

A wound requires more than a scratch or a graze, even though blood may show. It requires a penetration of both layers of skin – namely the dermis and epidermis. Internal ruptures do not count as a wound, nor does bruising, despite the blood loss (McLoughlin (1838) 173 ER 651). In Eisenhower [1984] QB 331, D shot V with an air gun and the pellet hit V near the eye, resulting in a bruise below the eyebrow and a bloodshot eye. D was charged under s.20. The injury satisfied neither form of the *actus reus* of s.20: it was insufficiently serious to count as grievous and nor did it count as a wound, because a wound is a break in the continuity of the skin. In short, an internal rupturing of the blood vessels, as here, is not a wound. This should have been charged as a s.47 offence.

Note that there is one exception to the rule that internal ruptures do not count as a wound; this is where the internal membrane ruptured takes the form of skin, as in the lining of the mouth and the urethra (Waltham (1849) 3 Cox 442).

#### Grievous bodily harm

Most commentators believe that it is time to dispense with words such as 'grievous', with which the 1861 Act is littered. It really is not helpful to clarity. DPP v Smith [1961] AC 290 defined grievous bodily harm as 'really serious bodily harm or injury'. I think you will agree that this is not a particularly helpful elaboration. No more helpful is Janjua [1999] 1 Cr App R 91, in which the Court of Appeal ruled that 'serious harm' is a good enough paraphrase of grievous bodily harm to be given to the jury. Whether an injury counts as 'really serious' or 'serious' is a question of fact for the jury. In Bollom [2003] EWCA Crim 2846, the Court of Appeal said that, in deciding whether harm was serious or not, the jury should take into account the age and state of physical fitness of the victim, as well as the extent and nature of the injury. It is fair to say, therefore, that what would be serious injury for one person might not be for another. Breaking an office worker's index finger may not be considered a serious injury, but the jury may take a different view if the victim is a concert pianist.

In practice, the jury's task is made easier by the filtering mechanism of the Crown Prosecution Service charging standards. These offer guidance to the prosecution as to what kind of injuries count as grievous for the purpose of deciding which offence to charge. Serious wounds count as grievous bodily harm; so does breaking an arm or leg, savage beatings, knocking someone unconscious for more than a brief period, injuries involving permanent disfigurement or long-term treatment and those involving serious loss of blood or requiring surgery. Grievous bodily harm also includes sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV (Dica [2004] EWCA Crim 1103) and serious psychiatric injury (Burstow [1997] 1 Cr App R 144).

#### Grievous bodily harm must be 'inflicted'

Until recently 'inflict' was thought to be narrower than 'cause' (the actus reus element in s.18). 'Inflicting grievous bodily harm' conjures up the vision of some form of application of force which delivers the harm, just as a knife or gun delivers a wound. This is supported by the presence in s.20 of the words 'either with or without any weapon or instrument', which implies some form of harm-delivering blow or application of force. This was the view taken in Clarence (1888) 22 QBD 23, where it was held that a husband who gave gonorrhoea to his wife during consensual intercourse was not guilty under s.20; he had caused GBH but not inflicted it. He had not inflicted GBH because he had not assaulted her, and he had not assaulted her because she consented to the intercourse. Clarence also stood for the proposition that for s.20 the harm must be delivered by force in the manner of a shot from a gun, a thrust with a knife or a blow from a stick. In Burstow, Clarence was disapproved. In this case, D had stalked his victim over a long period of time: he had made silent telephone calls, sent hate mail, followed her around and stolen clothing from her washing line. V suffered serious clinical depression as a result. The House of Lords held that serious depression counted as grievous bodily harm, just as depression counted as actual bodily harm (Ireland). Such harm could be inflicted in the absence of the application of force. It is not that kind of harm. It was

said that there was no meaningful difference between inflicting harm and causing harm. If this is the case, then, if Clarence were decided today, the husband would be guilty under s.20. In Dica, this was confirmed. D had intercourse with V without informing her that he was HIV positive. V contracted the virus. It was held that a serious sexually transmitted disease counted as serious bodily injury and that D had inflicted it. There was no requirement that the harm be delivered by any unlawful force, as Clarence had supposed. To inflict harm means simply to cause it, which D had done.

One distinction between 'cause' and 'inflict' may, however, remain. Cause is possibly slightly wider, in that one can cause someone serious harm by omission – say, by omitting to put out a fire that one has accidentally started – which results in injury to the victim (see Miller). It is not yet clear whether one can inflict serious harm by omission. (You may remember that one cannot commit common assault by omission.) In Burstow, it was said that it is simply a matter of correct linguistic usage. If so, it is arguable that, although it is certainly correct linguistic usage to say that D 'caused' V serious injury by failing to put the fire out, it is not so obviously correct usage to say that D 'wounded' or 'inflicted serious harm' on V (her son) by failing to stop V from injuring himself on a barbed wire fence. The words 'wound' and 'inflict', in other words, seem to imply the need for some form of action. However, there is no authority in support of this proposition, so it should be treated with caution.

#### Mens rea: s.20

The mens rea for s.20 OAPA is malice; that is, intention or subjective recklessness. The key point to remember is that, contrary to the correspondence principle, it is not necessary to prove that the accused intended or foresaw harm of the gravity described in s.20: Mowatt [1968] 1 QB 421. In Parmenter [1991] 2 WLR 408, the House of Lords approved Mowatt, concluding that the prosecution need prove only that D intended or foresaw the risk of some physical harm resulting from his shaking of his child for a conviction under s.20. It was not necessary to show that D intended or foresaw that the child would suffer serious injury.

### 9.2.3 Wounding with intent

By s.18 of the OAPA it is an offence to:

unlawfully and maliciously by any means whatsoever wound or cause any grievous bodily harm to any person, with intent to do some grievous bodily harm to any person, or with intent to resist or prevent  $(arrest) \dots$ 

The major, if not sole, difference between this offence and that of s.20 OAPA lies in the mens rea. Section 18 is a crime of specific intent, whereas s.20 can be committed either intentionally or recklessly.

Actus reus: s.18

It is again important to understand that there are two alternative conduct elements in s.18. The first is a wounding; the second is an infliction of grievous bodily harm (see the discussion on s.20 above).

#### **Illustration 3**

- a. D, wanting to seriously hurt V, takes a carving knife and thrusts it towards V's abdomen. V sidesteps and the knife catches him on the arm, causing bleeding.
- b. D smashes V over the head with an iron bar. This causes a fracture to V's skull.

Both these cases support a conviction under s.18, since both are done with the intention to cause GBH. In the first case there is a wounding without grievous bodily harm, while in the second case there is a causing of grievous bodily harm but no wounding.

Wounding

For the meaning of 'wounding', see above.

#### Grievous bodily harm

For the meaning of 'grievous bodily harm', see above.

The cases referred to above in relation to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (Dica) and serious psychiatric injury (Burstow) were decided in the context of the s.20 offence. It will be rare for such transmissions to be charged under s.18 because of the difficulty of proving the intent necessary.

#### Causing grievous bodily harm

We have dealt with the concept of cause before. Again, to remember what it is to cause harm, you may need to revisit Topic 4. Harm can be caused by an act, or by an omission in breach of duty (e.g. Pittwood (1902) 19 TLR 37, Instan [1893] 1 QB 450, Evans [2009] EWCA Crim 2243). The reference in s.18 to 'any means whatsoever' does not add anything to the normal rules of causation.

#### **Study task 5**

Return to Topic 4 and remind yourself of the principles governing causation. In particular, you must remember how not all 'but for' causes of a harm are the legal causes. Then answer the following question giving reasons and authority for your answers.

Jaz and Deepak attack Ali when he calls them names at a football match. Jaz hits the first blow which causes Ali to fall down. Jaz then loses interest and returns to watching the game. A few minutes later, when Jaz has left his seat to buy a drink, Deepak attacks Ali again, kicking him several times, causing him to suffer a ruptured spleen.

Has Ali's (serious) injury been caused by:

a. both Jaz and Deepak

b. only by Deepak?

Show feedback

Only by Deepak. The cause of this serious injury is a voluntary and independent act of Deepak, which, given that Jaz quits the fight, breaks the chain of causation.

#### Mens rea: s.18

Section 18 is a crime of ulterior intent. What makes it so serious is that, accompanying the wounding or the causing of grievous bodily harm, is an intention matching or exceeding the simple causing of the injury – that is, to cause GBH or to resist or prevent an arrest.

#### Intending grievous bodily harm

Whether the conduct element relied upon is a wound or GBH, the prosecution must also prove that the defendant intended to cause the victim GBH, or, if that cannot be proved, the alternative intention of resisting or preventing an arrest. In other words, if D wounds V but not seriously, the prosecution will fail on a s.18 charge unless they can prove that it was D's intention to cause a serious wound – that is, a wound amounting to GBH – or to resist arrest. In the case of D causing V GBH in some other way, the prosecution must prove that this level of injury was intended. The jury should not normally be given a *Woollin* direction, but should simply be asked to consider whether, on the basis of all the evidence, D not only intended to do what they did but specifically intended to cause V really serious injury, etc. (see Belfon [1976] 1 WLR 741, Purcell (1986) 83 Cr App R 45).

A jury which is not convinced that D had the necessary intention to cause grievous bodily harm can bring in the alternative verdict under s.20 (malicious infliction of GBH) (Mandair [1994] 2 All ER 715). In Banton [2007] EWCA Crim 1847, the trial judge refused to allow the jury this option on a charge of s.18, when D had smashed a bottle in V's face.

He told the jury that this could only mean one thing, namely that D intended grievous bodily harm. Do you agree?

## Mini lecture 2 - Non fatal offences

Prof William Wilson, Criminal law

Non-fatal offenses. What can be consented to? In this lecture, we shall be looking at the defense of consent in the context of non-fatal offenses. You'll find the necessary material in chapter nine of the study guide and chapter 11 of Wilson. Although we will be concentrating on one key area here, namely restrictions on the availability of consent to crimes of violence, I include some extra PowerPoint slides which I shall not be speaking to, but which are of equal importance and so demand your equal attention.

Consent is an unqualified defense to common assault, which comprises the separate offenses of assault and battery. This is because the definition of common assault requires lack of consent as an element in the *actus reus*. So a person who punches their friend playfully is not guilty of battery because it is presumed or implied that this was consented to by the friend, and so no wrong had been committed against them.

Compare this state of affairs with a case called Collins and Willcock in 1984. Here, a police officer took hold of a woman's arm to stop her walking away. She scratched the officer and was charged with assaulting a police officer in the execution of her duty. The woman's guilt depended upon whether the officer was acting lawfully or not. It was ruled that the officer was not. The key fact here was that the woman had not been arrested. This meant that grabbing the woman's arm was unlawful, as it had not been consented to and so, is amounted to a battery.

In most cases where consent is an issue, consent is not expressly given but is nevertheless implied. This is why contacts in the course of sporting events or sexual intimacy do not amount to battery. It was put this way in Collins and Willcock, "Implied consent exists where there was jostling in crowded places, handshakes, back slapping, tapping to gain attention provided no more force was used than is reasonably necessary in the circumstances. Here there was no consent given for the grabbing of the arm."

So what does consent consist of? This may be important in cases where the fact of consent is disputed by the parties. Most of the case law in this area involve cases of rape or other sexual assaults but the law is essentially the same for all nonfatal offences against the person.

In Olugboja, a case of rape, Lord Justice Dunn ruled that there is a difference between consenting to physical contact, albeit reluctantly, and simply submitting to it. Submission occurs where a dominant party overwhelms the submissive party's freedom of choice. This is what happened in Collins against Willcock. Although here the victim fought back, the police officer would have been guilty of battery, even if she had passively submitted to the use of force.

In four circumstances, apparent consent is or may be ineffective. These circumstances are: whether in lack of mental capacity, secondly, where consent is uninformed, thirdly, where apparent consent has been induced by fraud, and finally, if there are restrictions on the availability of consent, where the act consented to involved the infliction of physical harm.

We shall be dealing only with the final of these four circumstances, but you must ensure that you know, understand and remember the first three. You'll find discussion of these in the study guide at 9.24 and Wilson at 11.4.

We saw in Slide 2 that consent is automatically a defense to common assault, sexual assault, and rape. Indeed, it is only the absence of consent which makes these crimes. The position changes when we examine the more serious offenses against the person. Victim's consent is not a defense to murder, nor dueling. Beyond these obvious cases, there is no general defense of consent operating to excuse the infliction of physical harm.

In the Attorney-General's Reference No 6 of 1980, two youths sought to settle an argument by having a punch up. They were arrested and charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Their defense was consent. The Court of Appeal ruled that consent could not be used as a defense in cases of deliberate violence, as it was contrary to the public interest.

The principle which emerges from this case is that consent is not a defense to activities intended to cause harm unless the activities form a special public interest exception. This public interest exception applies in the following situations: surgery, including cosmetic surgery, tattooing, piercing, and similar forms of body alteration, boxing and comparable martial arts. It is presumed that physical harm caused in the course of one of these activities is lawful but it is always open for the legality of a particular practice to be tested in the courts. In the most recent case, a body piercer was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, for cutting off a client's ears. Although it was with their consent. In principle therefore, the legality of even surgery and tattooing may be challenged if of an extreme enough character. For example, the clinically unnecessary amputation of limbs by a surgeon to make the victim a more effective beggar or to satisfy a psychological need of a patient suffering the condition known as body dysmorphic disorder.

One controversial area of intentionally caused harm consented to by the victim involves sadomasochism. It is controversial since it tends to be a private activity engaged in for the sexual gratification of both parties. In both Donovan in 1934 and Brown in 1993, it was held that sadomasochism could not fall within a public interest exception. Their conclusion in both cases is that intentionally causing another person actual bodily harm or worse was inherently unlawful. Like murder and fistfights, the consent to the victim, would not make it lawful; even where this was done for the sexual gratification of the parties.

We've seen that except for certain privileged activities, such as surgery, the deliberate infliction of harm cannot be consented to. Acts which are not designed to cause harm, are subject to different rules and can be consented to if harm is foreseen. This is because following general principles, causing foreseen harm is not unlawful unless it is reckless, and an act will not be considered reckless if it is considered reasonable. The fact of the victim's consent, given that the injury was not deliberate, will usually mean that the physical contact was reasonable and so not reckless. For more on this, please see the lecture on the criminal damage.

There are three prime cases where a person causes harm unintentionally, but where the harm is nevertheless foreseen. These are:

Horseplay. Causing injury in the course of play fighting or other forms of horseplay is lawful if consented to. This point was made in Jones in 1987. In Jones, V suffered a ruptured spleen in the course of rough horseplay, which included his friends throwing V into the air. Their defense to a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm was that the victim consented impliedly as their purpose was not hostile.

The judge told the jury that consent was not effective where physical harm was inflicted. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction, ruling that the judge was wrong to direct the jury that victims implied consent was vitiated. The key point here was that the injury was accidental. A person cannot consent to intentional injury, can consent if the injury is accidental.

In sporting contests a person impliedly consents to all physical contact and its consequences, which are part and parcel of the game as it is played. This includes actions outside the rules of the game, such as dangerous tackles in football or rugby, so long as the act can be expected in games at that level. This is how Lord Wolf put it in Barnes. Take a look at this part of the judgment. This is a good statement of principle which should be remembered.

Perhaps, the most uncertain aspects of the rules on consent concerns what might be termed as rough or dangerous sex. This is because, as stated in Slingsby and confirmed in Konzani and Wilson, the Brown Principle does not apply where the harm caused is incidental to a legitimate sex act and is not performed for the purpose of causing harm. So biting or scratching in the course of intercourse, violent intercourse, and unintentionally transmitting an STD, if they cause the participants harm, is not unlawful if consented to.

## Discussion activity 1

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 11.5.A.3 'What can be consented to?' and answer the following questions.

- a. Based on your reading, do you think people should be able to consent to non-serious injury such as bruises and scratching?
- b. Do you think consent should be a defence to harm caused while boxing, where the purpose of the competition is to cause harm, possibly life-threatening harm, to the other?
- c. Can the exception in the case of boxing be reconciled with the absence of an exception in the case of sadomasochistic sexual relations between consenting adults? If not, should they both be criminal or neither?

Please post your answers/comments in the Topic 9 - Discussion activity 1.



## 9.3 Consent and offences against the person

We have already seen that absence of the victim's consent is one of the elements of common assault. This means that if D is charged with battery and the prosecution proves that D intentionally punched V in the stomach, and nothing more, the defence can make a submission of 'no case to answer'. This is because an essential element in the offence of common assault has been left unproven, namely that the force applied to V's body was not consented to.

This explains the decision in Slingsby, in which D was charged with manslaughter when his partner died of septicaemia following consensual, although extremely vigorous, sexual activity. The validity of the conviction depended upon whether the sexual activity involved an unlawful battery. The prosecution argued that it did, because it was extremely rough and had caused the victim harm. This argument was rejected on the basis that the activity was consensual. Since there was no battery, there could be no liability for constructive (unlawful act) manslaughter.

Different principles apply where D actually causes some physical injury to the victim and does so deliberately. The intentional causing of physical injury is considered inherently unlawful and, being inherently unlawful, the victim's consent cannot make it lawful (Donovan (1931)). Before exploring this aspect of consent, let us examine the actual concept of consent.

### **Section 71 Domestic Abuse Act 2021**

This concerns the defence of consent as it applies to non-fatal offences against the person. The long-debated and awaited Domestic Abuse Act 2021 has come fully into force. This is important legislation that brings clarity and coherence to the law on domestic abuse and domestic violence.

In terms of offences against the person, the Act introduces an important statutory provision on consent to harm under s.71. This section reads as follows:

**71 Consent to serious harm for sexual gratification not a defence**

(1) This section applies for the purposes of determining whether a person ('D') who inflicts serious harm on another person ('V') is guilty of a relevant offence.

(2) It is not a defence that V consented to the infliction of the serious harm for the purposes of obtaining sexual gratification (but see subsection (4)).

(3) In this section-

'relevant offence' means an offence under section 18, 20 or 47 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 ('the 1861 Act');

'serious harm' means-

(a) grievous bodily harm, within the meaning of section 18 of the 1861 Act,

(b) wounding, within the meaning of that section, or

(c) actual bodily harm, within the meaning of section 47 of the 1861 Act.

(4) Subsection (2) does not apply in the case of an offence under section 20 or 47 of the 1861 Act where-

(a) the serious harm consists of, or is a result of, the infection of V with a sexually transmitted infection in the course of sexual activity, and

(b) V consented to the sexual activity in the knowledge or belief that D had the sexually transmitted infection.

This section is important as it codifies the common law position set in the case of  $R \vee Brown$  [1993] UKHL 19 and states that consent to serious harm, if given for sexual gratification, is not a defence. The section also clarifies that this exclusion does not apply to transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). When dealing with transmission of STDs, common law principles derived from cases such as *Dica* (2004) and *Konzani* [2005] EWCA Crim 706 still prevail.

### 9.3.1 What is consent?

This is not an easy question to answer, since there is a vast range of responses possible, between, at one end of the consent spectrum, 'Oh yes, please!', and, at the other, 'Not over my dead body!' Clearly, if V submits to physical contact only due to force or the threat of force, this is not consent. However, the use of force or threat of force is not the only way consent can be vitiated. For example, deception or threats of financial or social harm or other non-violent threats or oppressive behaviour might invalidate consent. In Olugboja [1982] QB 320, a rape case, the Court of Appeal drew a distinction between reluctant acquiescence (consent) and mere submission (not consent).

Whether consent is present or not is a question of fact for the jury on the basis of its own common sense and experience of life. In Kirk [2008] EWCA Crim 434, the Court of Appeal upheld a conviction for rape of a destitute and hungry girl who submitted to intercourse so as to be able to buy food. This was decided under the definition of consent provided by s.74 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 but the basic principles are comparable. This was interpreted as a case of submission (I had no real choice) rather than reluctant acquiescence (oh, alright then).

Consent may be express or implied. Obvious examples of implied consent occur in cases of everyday physical contact between people who know each other. Punching a friend in jest will usually be treated as impliedly consented to. So is physical contact such as jostling in the street, in a queue, or in a railway carriage. As we shall see below, participants in sports are also deemed to consent to the ordinary 'rough and tumble' involved in the relevant sport, even where such rough and tumble falls outside the rules of the game.

### 9.3.2 Consent must be effective

Apparent consent can be rendered ineffective in a number of ways. In particular, the consent of those who do not understand exactly what they are consenting to  $-$  for example, the young or those who lack mental capacity  $-$  may be ineffective. For this reason, a tattooist was guilty of common assault for tattooing youths of 12 and 13, apparent consent notwithstanding (Burrell v Harmer [1967] Crim LR 169).

More generally, certain types of fraud may vitiate consent, namely if the nature of the fraud prevented the victim from understanding what they were consenting to or who was doing it. The courts have interpreted this strictly, as you will see below.

Since 2003, the position on consent in relation to sexual assaults, including rape, is regulated by the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The pre-2003 Act law, which is essentially similar to the provisions in the Act, is still authoritative in relation to the non-sexual assaults dealt with in this topic. Two deceptions vitiate consent, namely deception as to identity, and deception as to the nature and quality ('nature and purpose' in the 2003 Act) of the act. So, in Tabassum [2000] 2 Cr App R 328, the defendant induced women to submit to breast examinations by misrepresenting his medical qualifications. The Court of Appeal held that such mistakes could vitiate consent, since the victims were consenting to one thing (medical examination) and were getting another (indecent assault). An example of the other form of deception is Melin [2019] EWCA Crim 557. The appellant claimed falsely to be medically qualified before administering Botox injections. The Court of Appeal ruled that such a misrepresentation could vitiate consent if the fact of being medically qualified was a condition of the complainant giving consent. If so, the deception would go to the question of the appellant's identity and the legal validity of the consent given.

It is important to understand that consent is not vitiated simply because a person would not have agreed to the contact had they known all the relevant facts. For example, in Bolduc v Bird [1967] SCR 677, D asked V's consent to conduct a medical examination on her in the presence of his 'medical student', who in fact was not his medical student but a friend. It was held that her consent was not vitiated and there was no assault. She was not mistaken

as to the identity of the person performing the procedure – he was her doctor – nor as to its nature or quality. It was an authentic medical examination. Compare Richardson [1999] QB 444, in which V submitted to dental treatment by a dentist who had been struck off. It was held that V's consent was not vitiated by the fact that her choice was not fully informed. Her mistake was as to the dentist's status rather than the identity of the dentist.

Judges are increasingly requiring consent to be fully informed for it to be operative. Melin is an instance of this trend. It is difficult to reconcile Richardson and Melin, but the probable, if thin, distinguishing feature is that Richardson was a qualified dentist and so was giving authentic dental treatment, albeit she had no authority to do so. In Melin, by contrast, the defendant was claiming to be a person he was not. An area where the courts have shown themselves to be willing, understandably, to develop the protection offered victims of deception beyond cases of identity or nature and quality of the act is where the deception compromises the victim's personal safety. This can be seen in relation to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. In Dica (2004) and Konzani [2005] EWCA Crim 706, the Court of Appeal ruled that consent to the act of intercourse is vitiated for the purpose of common assault, ss.47 and 20 OAPA, if – unknown to V but known to  $D - D$  is suffering from a sexually transmitted disease. Consent is vitiated although the victim was neither mistaken as to the defendant's identity nor as to the nature or quality of the act they were performing (sexual intercourse). Please note that consent to the act of intercourse for the purpose of the crime of rape is not vitiated in this case, since the act of intercourse was what the victims consented to and was what took place.

### 9.3.3 Consent and violence

The final limitation on consent must now be discussed. This is that, although (absence of) consent is an essential element in common assault, it is not an essential element in crimes of violence such as ss.47, 20 and 18 OAPA. This means, in effect, that the victim's consent is not normally a defence to a crime of violence. So consent is a defence to a kiss, a tap, a tickle or a slap, but it is not a defence to a private physical fight to settle an argument (as occurred in A-G's Reference (No 6 of 1980) [1981] QB 715). In this case, Lord Lane CJ said:

It is not in the public interest that people should try to cause, or should cause, each other actual bodily harm for no good reason. Minor struggles are another matter.

In reaching this decision, the Court of Appeal approved the case of *Donovan* [1934] 2 KB 498. The appellant was charged with indecent and common assault upon a girl whom he had beaten with a cane, with her consent, for his own sexual gratification. Explaining his decision, Swift J said at 507:

If an act is unlawful in the sense of being in itself a criminal act, it is plain that it cannot be rendered lawful because the person to whose detriment it is done consents to it. No person can license another to commit a crime...As a general rule, although it is a rule to which there are well established exceptions, it is an unlawful act to beat another person with such a degree of violence that the infliction of bodily harm is a probable consequence, and when such an act is proved, consent is immaterial.

#### **Illustration 4**

- 1. Alan has an informal boxing match with his friend, Brenda. In the course of the match, Alan and Brenda land several blows to the body. These do not result in any significant harm.
- 2. Stephen and Richard have an informal boxing match. In the course of the match, Stephen and Richard land several blows to the body and the face. Stephen suffers a broken nose and cuts and bruises as a result.

In the first case, if Alan and/or Brenda were prosecuted for common assault, they would have an absolute defence, namely consent.

In the second case, if Richard were prosecuted for assault occasioning actually bodily harm, he would have no defence. Consent is not a defence to informal fighting causing actual bodily harm.

Note that if Richard were charged, as he could be, only with common assault, he would have a defence as per the first case, since common assault, unlike assault occasioning actually bodily harm, requires proof that V did not consent.

Let us examine more closely the claim that consent is ineffective where physical injury has been sustained. It is more accurate to say that, in the case of **deliberately** inflicted harm, consent will be ineffective unless the activity from which the harm derives is privileged as being in the public interest. In the case where the harm is not deliberately inflicted, consent will usually be effective because of the public interest presumption that people should be free to take risks of physical harm.

### 9.3.4 Deliberate infliction of harm

A-G's Reference (No 6 of 1980) is authority, in effect, for the proposition that where injury is inflicted deliberately it cannot be consented to, unless the context within which the injury is inflicted, for example boxing or surgery, is specially privileged on public interest grounds. Causing injury for sexual gratification is not deemed to be in the

public interest. In Brown [1994] 1 AC 212, a case involving a consensual homosexual orgy in which quite serious injuries involving the genitals were deliberately inflicted, Lord Templeman for the House of Lords stated:

In my view the line properly falls to be drawn between assault at common law and the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm created by s.47 of the 1861 Act, with the result that consent of the victim is no answer to anyone charged with the latter offence or with a contravention of s.20 unless the circumstances fall within one of the well-known exceptions such as organised sporting contests and games, parental chastisement or reasonable surgery.

In *Emmett*, The Times, 15 October 1999, consent was similarly not available where a heterosexual couple engaged in consensual sado-masochistic activities of a particularly dangerous nature designed to enhance sexual pleasure, including the burning of the woman's chest with lighter fuel and partial suffocation.

The long debated and awaited Domestic Abuse Act 2021 has come fully into force, providing some clarity in this area. In terms of offences against the person, the Act introduces an important statutory provision on consent to harm under s.71 that says that consent to serious harm for sexual gratification is not a defence. The section goes onto clarify in s.71(3) that all key offences (ss.18, 20 and 47) are considered relevant offences and serious harm for the purposes of this section includes GBH, wounding and ABH. This section is important as it codifies the common law position set out in R v Brown [1993] UKHL 19 and states that consent to serious harm, if given for sexual gratification, is not a defence.

#### Exceptions

Surgery, tattooing and body alteration

Other exceptions to the rule that deliberately inflicted harm cannot be consented to include, as Lord Templeman remarks, 'reasonable surgery'. The implication behind the use of the word 'reasonable' is not clear, but probably does not require the surgery to be clinically necessary but, rather, reasonable according to the ethical standards informing surgery at the relevant time. Sex-change operations and cosmetic surgery are therefore capable of being consented to, subject always to the requirement that the consent is informed. In the case of minors, the consent of both parents is necessary for non-clinically necessary procedures such as circumcision (Re J (Prohibited steps order: circumcision) [2000] 1 FLR 571. The position with regard to consent in the context of gender reassignment for minors is currently under review.

Tattooing, ear piercing and other forms of body piercing and body alteration may also be consented to if reasonable (Brown). In Wilson [1997] QB 47, the Court of Appeal ruled that it was not unlawful for a man to brand his partner on the buttocks with a hot knife when it was consensual and done for purposes of adornment rather

than simply to cause injury. The Court said that the criminal law should be slow to interfere with what people do in private. This does not affect the decisions in Brown and Emmett. The rather fragile distinction to be drawn between these cases and Wilson is that, in the latter, the consensual hurt suffered by V was incidental rather than the point of the exercise. The Court drew an analogy between this case and a case of tattooing, which is also lawful where consented to. Compare also the recent case of R v BM [2018] EWCA Crim 560. The Court of Appeal ruled that consent would not render lawful the removal by a tattoo artist of a customer's ear, of another customer's nipple or the division of a tongue into two to produce an effect similar to a snake. There was no possible public benefit attached to such procedures and, as they involved gratuitous mutilation, they were too far removed from tattooing and piercing to sustain the argument that criminalising then would be an unreasonable interference with personal liberty.

#### **Study task 6**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 11.5.A.3 'What can be consented to?'. On the basis of what you read there do you agree with the decision in  $R \vee BM$ ? Do you think a similar approach should be taken in relation to full facial tattoos?

**Boxing, wrestling and martial arts**

Boxing is a genuine exception to the rule that consent is ineffective in the case of deliberately inflicted injuries. It attracts a special privilege, in that even acts intended to cause serious injury can be consented to. This is a peculiar exception, given that informal fighting attracts no such privilege and that the only positive public interest benefit discernible is the enjoyment spectators receive in watching the spectacle – hardly a 'good reason', one would suppose, for permitting it. It certainly sits ill with the position with respect to consensual sadomasochism, where the participants themselves experience the enjoyment.

Wrestling and martial arts are also privileged, although, in these cases, with more reason, because these sports, unlike boxing, do not have the intentional infliction of injury as the point of the activity. Injuries sustained here are more incidental rather than constitutive of the sport. Consent to incidental injuries is probably effective for the same reason as other contact sports, as will now be discussed.

### 9.3.5 Non-deliberate infliction of harm

#### Games and sports

The other privileged activities referred to by Lord Templeman include lawful sports and games. Consent is effective in relation to this category for a different reason than that for boxing – namely that the taking of risks and engaging in dangerous pursuits is normal human activity and should be criminalised only if the risk-taking is contrary to

public policy. Injuries inflicted in the course of contact sports such as football and rugby will therefore be *prima* facie lawful unless deliberately inflicted, in which case consent, even were it to be present, is ineffective.

This is the conclusion to be drawn from Barnes [2004] EWCA Crim 3246, where the Court of Appeal said that resort to the criminal courts in cases of sporting injury should be exceptional. Most sports have their own codes of discipline which can properly be deployed in the face of dangerous play. An instinctive error, reaction or misjudgement in the heat of a game was not to be treated any differently. However, intentionally caused injuries give no outright immunity:

In making a judgment as to whether conduct is criminal or not, it has to be borne in mind that, in highly competitive sports, conduct outside the rules can be expected to occur in the heat of the moment, and even if the conduct justifies not only being penalised but also a warning or even a sending off, it still may not reach the threshold level required for it to be criminal. That level is an objective one and does not depend upon the views of individual players. The type of the sport, the level at which it is played, the nature of the act, the degree of force used, the extent of the risk of injury, the state of mind of the defendant are all likely to be relevant in determining whether the defendant's actions go beyond the threshold.
*(Per Lord Woolf CJ at [15])*

#### Horseplay

The decision in A-G's Reference (No 6 of 1980) must be distinguished from cases of rough and undisciplined horseplay. The essence of the former was that the blows landed by the accused were intended to cause injury. Play fighting and other expressions of high spirits which result in physical injury are not so treated and consent may therefore be a defence. In Jones (1986) 83 Cr App R 375, D (a schoolboy) and others, to celebrate V's birthday, subjected V to the 'bumps' (a procedure involving throwing the subject into the air and allowing them to drop on the ground). This caused V to suffer a broken arm and a ruptured spleen. D's appeal against a conviction under s.47 was allowed. Given the context, there was evidence of either express or implied consent to the 'bumps' procedure. In any event, even if consent were absent, such that the *actus reus* was established, the defendants' belief that V was a willing participant meant that they lacked the mens rea for the crime charged.

#### Sexual relations

Consent, express or implied, is effective in relation to harms committed during sexual activity, so long as these are not deliberately inflicted for their own sake (see Brown, above). In Slingsby (1995), D inserted his hand into V's vagina and rectum with her consent. A ring which he was wearing caused internal cuts, and V later died of

septicaemia. In the subsequent trial for manslaughter, D was held not to have committed an assault due to the victim's consent, and so D could not be liable for manslaughter.

In cases involving the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, informed consent will be effective to prevent liability under s.47 or s.20. Authority for this is Konzani (2005), in which the Court of Appeal made clear that so long as the transmittee of the disease knew of the disease at the time of intercourse, she consented both to the intercourse and to the risk of transmission of the disease. This has not changed since the introduction of s.71 of Domestic Abuse Act 2021 as s.71 also clarifies that this exclusion of consent as a defence for harm does not apply to the transmission of STDs. When dealing with the transmission of STDs, common law principles derived from cases such as *Dica* (2004) and *Konzani* [2005] EWCA Crim 706 still prevail.

#### **Study task 7**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 11.5.A.3 'What can be consented to?' and answer the following questions.

- a. Is it possible to reconcile the decision in Slingsby with that in *Emmett* and Brown?
- b. Is it possible to reconcile the decision in Konzani with that in *Emmett* and Brown?
- c. Read the case of Aitken (1992). Do you think this case was rightly decided?

Show feedback

- a. Yes. What Mr Slingsby did was to engage in 'rough' sex. The harm was incidental. The harm occurring in Brown and Emmett was not incidental. It was the whole point of the exercise.
- b. Yes. People can consent to the risks associated with having unprotected sex, even if these are life threatening. Autonomy is all about the right to take risks. We celebrate rather than deprecate mountain climbers and arctic explorers. People cannot consent to being torture victims. Autonomy does not take priority over the moral principle that deliberately hurting people is wrong.

## Mini lecture 3 - TACKLING MULTI-PART PROBLEM QUESTIONS

Dr Laura Lammasniemi

Welcome to this short lecture in criminal law. My name is Dr Laura Lammasniemi. In this lecture, we'll be focusing on how to master multi-part problem questions.

In this short video, I'll cover strategies for handling multi-part exam questions. After that, we'll delve into a section of a past exam question centered on offences against the person.

The criminal law exam is split into two parts: Part One and Part Two. Part One comprises a multipart exam question that all students must answer. Meanwhile, Part Two consists of several questions, from which you must select and answer three. These questions in Part Two may involve essays or various types of problem questions. When it comes to mastering exam questions overall, nothing beats practice. While having a strong grasp of criminal law concepts is crucial of course, excelling in exams isn't solely about knowledge depth and breadth. It's also about your ability to effectively address specific questions and apply your knowledge to those questions. Therefore, it's essential to practice various types of exam questions, including essays, problem questions, and multi-part exam questions. Once you've honed your technique for answering questions, you can approach exam day with confidence, focusing primarily on your knowledge.

I highly recommend that everyone incorporates reviewing past exam papers and examiner reports into their practice routine. Additionally, the Laws VLE offers numerous exam activities and past questions on other topics for further practice.

In this video, I'll concentrate on Part One questions – the multi-part exam questions – and discuss strategies for tackling them effectively.

This question you see on the screen is a past exam question. It is a multi-part question on the topic of offences against the person. I will walk through the question first and then we will consider how to answer it.

The question reads:

Lazim, a malicious joker, inflates a paper bag and explodes it behind Mary's back. The shock causes Mary to jump sideways and bang her head on a cupboard door, causing bruising.

Lazim then adds roughly ground glass to Zoe's face cream. When Zoe uses the face cream, she suffers abrasions to her cheeks which turn septic necessitating head bandages, cortisone injections and a course of antibiotics. Zoe is left with slight scarring to the cheeks.

When Moeen, a police officer, hears what Lazim has done he runs after Lazim to arrest him. Lazim hides in a doorway intending, when Moeen runs past, to stick out his foot and trip him. By mistake, he trips up Noor, a young girl running home after school, causing her to cut her leg.

This is the question. On the right-hand side of the screen, you'll notice a series of questions based on the question. Initially, it might seem overwhelming to have so many sub-questions to tackle. But don't worry. As we go through them together, you'll realise that each of these questions follow a clear pattern.

When you approach the multi-part exam question in Part One, start by reading through all the questions. Plan what you'll say for each part before you begin writing. Different questions will ask for varying things and expect answers of different lengths.

A problem question typically covers 3-5 criminal issues, with a set of similar questions for each issue. In our current scenario, we have three issues: Mary's head injury, Zoe's harm from contaminated face cream, and Noor's injury during an arrest resistance by Lazim.

You'll notice there's a distinct set of questions for each scenarios: Questions a to c focus on Mary, d to g focus on Zoe and h to k focus on Noor. This allows you to break down the scenario into smaller, manageable sections.

The questions in Part One may vary, but they often follow a similar format to what you see here. Question a might inquire about the charge, question b might inquire about why that charge was brought and ask you to apply the law, and c will discuss possible defences. This structure mirrors how you would go about answering any problem question: first, identify the relevant law, then explain how it applies to this particular scenario.

Let's look at the question format in more detail, before returning to the question at hand. In any given scenario, the initial question you'll encounter is typically about which law applies. This question might be framed as:

## *a.If you were a prosecutor, what would be your preferred charge in relation to the defendant?*

For this question, the answer should be brief. You can simply identify the statutory or common law offence in question. There is no need for an explanation or analysis at this section.

The second question asks for analysis so for example here question b reads:

## *b. Give reasons for your choice in (a) including an explanation as to why you chose as you did rather than choosing a different charge.*

This is clearly an analysis question, which requires a more detailed and longer response. Here, you'll delve into the actus reus and mens rea of the offense in question. It's crucial to incorporate your understanding of relevant cases and use them as evidence to support your analysis of whether the defendant has fulfilled the actus reus and mens rea requirements. So this section requires you to apply the law to the facts.

The third question is often something like:

*c.If you were a defence counsel, what arguments would you advance in response to the charge in (a)?* 

In this part you should assess whether the defendant had any potential defences. Did they potentially fail to meet one or more elements of the offence? While there might not be obvious defences (like self defence), there could be factors that mitigate their liability, such as reducing a murder charge to manslaughter in cases of homicide, or in cases of offences against the person maybe you could reduce the charges from section 18 charge to section 20, or even section 47. This sub-question allows you to consider any factors that could reduce the defendant's liability if there are no outright defenses are applicable here.

Sometimes, you might come across a follow up question on this that asks:

*d.If you were prosecuting counsel, how would you counter the arguments raised in (c)?* 

This answer can be usually quite brief. Here your answer would depend entirely on what you said in (c) and you should attempt to directly respond to any defence or mitigation you put forward in that section.

Next, we will move on to consider how to apply this knowledge and discussion in practice.

Now, we will return to the problem question and work through the first scenario together. You can pause the video here if you want to attempt to answer it yourself before listening on.

We will now answer the sub-questions relating to the first part of the scenario. The first part reads:

Lazim, a malicious joker, inflates a paper bag and explodes it behind Mary's back. The shock causes Mary to jump sideways and bang her head on a cupboard door, causing bruising.

The first sub-question we must therefore tackle, asks the following:

(a) If you were a prosecutor, what would be your preferred charge in relation to Lazim and the matter of Mary and her bruised head?

To answer this, you can simply say 'My preferred charge would be s.47 of Offences against the Person Act (OAPA) 1861.' Remember this first sub-question is simply about identifying the correct charge.

The second question, asks us to do the following:

(b) Give reasons for your choice in (a) including an explanation as to why you chose as you did rather than choosing a different charge.

This should be the longest of your answers; this is where you explain why Lazim has committed the offence you have identified. You could say, for example:

Section 47 of OAPA 1861 consists of three elements: assault/battery, actual bodily harm (ABH) and causation. Firstly, Lazim committed battery as he recklessly applied unlawful force to Mary – which includes the bang to her head. As per the case of Haystead, it doesn't matter the contact was not direct. Prosecution could also argue that assault was present. Assault is defined in Venna as 'intentionally or recklessly leading someone to apprehend the application to his body of immediate unlawful force'. Secondly, the injury Mary suffered constitutes ABH, defined in the case of Donovan [1934] as 'any hurt or injury that is ... more than merely transient and trifling.' The bang causes Mary to suffer bruising which following the case of Donovan constitutes ABH. Finally, there is need to show that the battery Lazim committed caused the ABH. This element too is satisfied as Mary has been caused harm but not serious harm. The case of Roberts confirms there is no additional mens rea element for the injury, so the prosecution does not need to show foresight of injury, simply that be committed the assault of battery that that caused the harm.

The final question for this scenario, asks the following:

(c) If you were Lazim's defence counsel, what arguments would you advance in response to the charge in (a)?

Remember when you answer these c questions, you can put forward any defences or arguments that would reduce Lazim's liability. You could, for example, argue the following:

If the prosecution argued that Lazim had committed the unlawful act of assault, I would argue that the elements were not met. An assault, as per Venna, requires an act leading someone to expect physical contact. Hearing a bang is not of that nature. Secondly, in any case, I would want to argue that the defence of consent applies. Lazim was a malicious joker and this implies he simply wanted to play around, and this would be an act of horseplay (as per cases of Jones v Aitken) and so he could rely on victim's consent.

So there you have it we have now fully tackled the first scenario of this problem question. We have identified the offence, we have considered whether and how the offence applies to Lazim and we have also considered potential defences.

Thank you very much for listening. The next step is for you to put all this discussion into practice and try your hand at these questions. You can practice the scenario with Lazim and attempt to complete the rest of the question. Alternatively, you can complete another multi-part exam question activity on this topic.

I hope you have found this video helpful in tackling multi-part problem questions, and don't forget that practice makes perfect!

## Sample examination question 1

**Question**

Wendy runs a beauty salon. Her first client of the day is Margot who asks her to inject Botox into her face to get rid of her wrinkles. Wendy injects her but two days later Margot's face is lopsided and she cannot move her facial muscles. Her doctor says the paralysis will ease over a few weeks.

Wendy's next client is Barbara who asks Wendy to inject her lips with chemical filler. Wendy finds that she has no clean needles left and so she uses the same needle that she used for Margot's injections. She does not tell Barbara that she is using an unclean needle. Barbara's lips swell enormously and are badly infected.

A few days later, Tom, Barbara's husband, comes into the salon and starts shouting at Wendy that she is a "useless, incompetent fool". Wendy was burgled a few weeks ago and, traumatised by the burglary, she fears that Tom is another burglar. She grabs a bottle of hairspray and sprays it into Tom's eyes. Tom is temporarily blinded.

- a. If you were a prosecutor, what would be your preferred charge against Wendy for the injuries to **Margot's face?**
- b. Give reasons for your choice in (a) including an explanation as to why you chose as you did rather than choosing a different charge.
- c. If you were Wendy's defence counsel, what arguments would you raise in response to the charge in  $(a)?$
- d. How would the prosecutor respond to counter the arguments in (c)?
- e. If you were a prosecutor, what would be your preferred charge against Wendy in respect of Barbara's infected lips?
- f. Give reasons for your choice in (e) including an explanation as to why you chose as you did rather than a different charge.
- g. If you were Wendy's defence counsel, what arguments would you raise in response to the charge in  $(e)$ ?
- h. How would the prosecutor respond to counter the arguments in  $(g)$ ?
- i. If you were a prosecutor, what would be your preferred charge against Wendy for Tom's injuries?

- j. Give reasons for your choice in (i) including an explanation as to why you chose as you did rather than choosing a different charge.
- k. If you were Wendy's defence counsel, what arguments would you raise in response to the charge in  $(i)?$
- $\blacksquare$  How would the prosecutor respond to counter the arguments in  $(k)$ ?

A tip for future! Before you start writing, please read all the questions carefully and plan your answer to multi-part exam question. The questions (a)–(I) tease out aspects of the problem in turn so do not write everything in (a)–(c).

**Feedback**

These are indicative answers only and in note format. You should always write full sentences and paragraphs when answering any exam questions.

Please note that these answers are indicative only, you could have argued s.20 instead of s.47 OAPA at various points and got high marks if the analysis was well done:

- a. Most likely: assault/battery occasioning in actual bodily harm under s.47 of Offences against the Person Act 1861.
- b. Temporary facial paralysis: The paralysis is not permanent, though unsightly and distressing. In the analysis you could refer to the following points: Miller/Donovan for definition of ABH. Assault or battery could be found through the injection (subject to consent being invalid). Injuries are not sufficiently serious to amount to GBH but could this be s.20/18 if the injection is perceived as wound? Section 47 more appropriate for the level of injury sustained; can refer to Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) charging standards.
- c. Defence would argue M consented to the injury and so the 'assault' of the injection (therefore no assault). They would further argue that there is consent to ABH as the expectation is to paralyse some muscles in the face. Defence would argue botox/ beauty treatments are a lawful activity (like piercing?) – discuss using Brown, Smith or BM can be introduced for beautification/cosmetic, and limits of consent.
- d. Prosecution would argue the consent to ABH is not incurred through a lawful activity. You should discuss BM – this could be interpreted as a 'surgical procedure' or body modification but it is not a piercing?
- e. Infection of lips is a disease. Probably ABH: s.47 OAPA 1861; could be s.20 too.
- f. Assault through injection, infection treatable with anti-biotics but painful could amount to ABH following Donovan definition. Could be s.20/18 if injection perceived as wound but injury unlikely to be serious enough for GBH.

- g. Defence would argue there is consent to the injection e.g. this is lawful activity?
- h. Prosecution would argue there is deception as to the risk of infection (Dica).
- i. Temporary blinding with use of chemical. Arguably GBH: s.20 OAPA 1861; or ABH: s.47 OAPA.
- j. Serious, painful and debilitating injury could amount to GBH s.18. Could be ABH as not permanent blindness.
- k. Defence would run self-defence mistaken honest belief in the need to use force. Traumatised by previous burglary (apply Oye). Uses reasonable force - cannot weigh to a nicety etc and previous trauma (Martin).
- I. Prosecution would argue force used unreasonable. Would refute trauma as a relevant characteristic.
