## Learning objectives

At the end of this lecture you should be able:

- To understand the policy behind the changes to the law on consent and fault effected by the Sexual Offences Act 2003
- To understand the effect of sections 75 and 76 in protecting the complainant from intrusive questioning
- To understand the difference between the absolute presumptions contained in section 76 and the rebuttable presumptions contained in section 75
- To give examples from the cases of some of these presumptions
- To explain the role of judges and jury in relation to proof of consent and proof of fault
- To explain the procedure followed where a presumption is applied and where it is not

• The law relating to sexual offences, particularly rape, was a major problem prior to the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Foremost of these problems concerned proving consent and the fault element.

The prosecution had to prove:

1. Absence of consent

2. The defendant knew that the complainant was not consenting or might not be consenting.

• This was a tough burden to discharge which caused serious problems for complainants in court.

## Rape – SOA 03 (s1)

Section 1 SOA 2003 reads as follows:

- *(1) A person (A) commits an offence if—*
  - *(a) he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with his penis,*
  - *(b) B does not consent to the penetration, and*
  - *(c) A does not reasonably believe that B consents.*
- *(2) Whether a belief is reasonable is to be determined having regard to all the circumstances, including any steps A has taken to ascertain whether B consents.*
- *(3) Sections 75 and 76 apply to an offence under this section.*

### Consent

The 2003 Act makes it easier to establish the offence and protects the victim from unnecessarily obtrusive questioning.

- The Act states that in certain circumstances, where section 75 or 76 applies, consent is presumed absent and fault is presumed to be present. In those circumstances the prosecution do not have to prove D's liability. It is presumed.
- Where section 75 or 76 does not apply the prosecution still have a much easier job in establishing the fault element.

### Presumptions

- Section 76 provides for 2 **conclusive** presumptions where, if the facts are found as alleged, the defendant is found automatically guilty without the need for absence of consent and fault to be proven. The presumption that there was no consent and absence of reasonable belief cannot be rebutted or challenged by the defence.
- Section 75 provides, by contrast, 6 evidential presumptions where if the facts are established as alleged, guilt is presumed **unless** the defence can rebut the presumption by providing plausible evidence that despite these facts the complainant did in fact consent, or the accused did in fact have a reasonable belief that the complainant was consenting.

### S.76 Conclusive Presumptions

- Section 76 (1) SOA 03: tells us that it will be *"***conclusively presumed** that*:* 
  - *(a) that the complainant did not consent to the relevant act, and*
  - *(b) that the defendant did not believe that the complainant consented to the relevant act."*

in either of two situations, namely by s.76(2), where:

- a) the defendant intentionally deceived the complainant as to the **nature** or **purpose** of the relevant act, OR
- b) where the defendant intentionally induced the complainant to consent to the relevant act by **impersonating a person known personally** to the complainant.

• The case of *Tabbassum* is an example of subsection (a) and *Elbekkay* is an example of subsection (b). These have been dealt with in the lecture on consent to non fatal offences, and so will not be dealt with here but what must be remembered is that if the prosecution can prove facts which support a finding that there was an intentional deception as to the nature or purpose of the act (*Tabassum*) or a case of impersonation (*Elbekkay*) that is all the prosecution need to establish guilt.

- *Jheeta* is a good illustration of the procedure to be followed when a presumption is raised unsuccessfully.
- Understanding this procedure is most important.

If the prosecution fails to convince the court that a presumption applies, as here, then the prosecution is back to square one. It must prove the complainant did not consent and they must disprove the defendant's claim that his belief that he/she did consent was held on reasonable grounds.

• Whether (s)he did consent or not is decided in accordance with section 74 which states that consent is present *if (s)he agrees by choice, and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice*.*'*

### S. 75 Evidential Presumptions

S.75 (1) provides 6 rebuttable presumptions, that is presumptions which operate unless the defendant can rebut or challenge them by reference to the evidence. It tells us that in certain circumstances, it is presumed

*a. that the complainant did not consent to the relevant act, and b. that the defendant did not believe that the complainant consented to the relevant act."*

• Where it is rebutted, the prosecution must prove absence of consent (and fault) in the normal way (by reference to section 74) (as happened in Jheeta).

### Evidential Presumptions

Section 75(2) sets out the 6 sets of circumstances where it is presumed that the complainant did not consent and that D did not entertain a reasonable belief in that consent.

- The first three are cases where the use of violence or threats of violence either to the complainant or another accompany the sexual act.
- Also a presumption applies where the complainant was being unlawfully detained.

The final three involve situations where the presence of consent would be surprising or difficult to come by, namely where:

- the complainant was asleep or unconscious,
- the complainant was not able to communicate consent because of disability
- the complainant was intoxicated as a result of having been given, without her consent, a substance which was capable of causing the complainant to be stupefied or overpowered at the time of the relevant act.

## Dealing with Evidential Presumptions
- For the presumption to apply the prosecution prove beyond reasonable doubt that the circumstance existed, eg. that the complainant was asleep, when D had intercourse with her.
- The complainant is then presumed not to have consented and D is presumed to have known that.
- For these presumptions, however, the defence has a right of rebuttal.
- The evidence needed to rebut the presumption must be plausible. If it is not, the judge will remove the evidence from the jury and conviction will be affirmed. A good illustration occurred in *Ciccarrelli*.

**Case Study** - Ciccarrelli with differences!

*During the course of the party D and C both become intoxicated, kiss and engage in some petting. C goes to lie down in D's room and goes to sleep. Later C wakes up to find D on top of her trying to have sex.* 

- The presumption applies clearly, but here there is a possibility that D will succeed in rebutting the presumption. Although C clearly did **not** consent to what D did, D has got grounds for thinking she would. Whether they are reasonable grounds is a matter for the judge.
- If the judge thinks they may be reasonable grounds the presumption will be rebutted and the prosecution are back to square one and must prove all the elements of the offence in the usual way.

Lets change the facts of Ciccarreli to make his evidence more plausible.

They must go to trial and prove to the satisfaction of the jury:

- i. that C did not consent (this will not be difficult)
- ii. that D did not have reasonable grounds for believing that C did consent (this will be more tricky).

The decision is for the jury. What is your verdict? The next few slides provide a summary of what we have learnt so far together with other material you must look at.

## Summary (con)

- For rape (and most sexual offences) the prosecution must prove absence of consent on the part of the complainant and an absence of reasonable belief on the part of the defendant. It does so:
- 1. By establishing that a conclusive presumption applies (eg deception as to the nature and purpose of the act). If it succeeds guilt is established.
- 2. By establishing that an evidential presumption applies (eg V was unconscious) which the defendant is unable to rebut.
- 3. If neither of those options is available, the prosecution must prove absence of consent by reference to section 74
- 4. The prosecution must then prove the fault element by proving beyond reasonable doubt that D did not believe V to be consenting or, if he did believe V to be consenting, that he did not have reasonable grounds for forming that belief.
- The decision is for the jury
- It is beyond the scope of this lecture to deal with section 74 but it must be understood that the definition of consent it contains is not very helpful. In particular serious problems of application arise with respect to the following Problem Cases
- 1. Non violent threats or inducements
- 2. Intoxicated victims
- 3. Deceptions which do not fall within section 76

## Consent and section 74 (con)

- Problem Cases
- 1. Non violent threats or inducements eg *R v Kirk* (2008), *Ali and Ashraf* (2015)
- 2. Intoxicated victims, eg *Bree* and *Kamki*
- 3. Deceptions which do not fall within section 76, eg *Linekar, McNally*
- To understand this area properly you must ensure you read Wilson and chapter 8.4.3 Study Guide and complete the activities.
