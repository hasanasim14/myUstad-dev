# Affirmative Defences

Distinguishing affirmative defences and why it matters Professor William Wilson

## Learning objectives

At the end of this lecture you should be able

- To identify the essential elements in common of duress, self defence and necessity
- To identify the elements which differentiate the defences
- To understand that necessity and self defence are justification defences and duress is an excuse defence
- To understand the significance of a justification as opposed to an excuse.
- Understand why it might make a difference to the question of guilt if the defence can bring their defence within the umbrella of one of the defences as opposed to another.
- Apply the understanding gained above to solving the case studies appearing in the Study Guide 11.10

## Defences of reasonable reaction

- Duress, necessity and self defence have something in common:
- Someone is exposed to an immediate or imminent threat of harm
- D acts to prevent that harm occurring
- D's action necessitates a breach of a criminal prohibition.
- D's action is reasonable and proportionate

### What's the difference?

- 1. Duress is an excuse **not** a justification. The excuse is 'Don't blame me. I'm only human.' Duress of circumstances, which is necessity in its excuse form, is the same. Self defence and the other form of necessity are not excuses. They are justifications. The claim here is that their action was permitted by the law.
- 2. Because duress (including duress of circumstances) is an excuse it is not available to murder or attempted murder. Self defence is a defence to murder and in certain circumstances so is necessity.
- 3. Self defence is action taken **against** a **wrongdoer** posing an unjust threat **to repel** this threat eg an attacker. Duress and necessity can be used as a defence even where an **innocent person** is victimised. Eg *Re A (conjoined twins).*
- 4. Self defence can only be used for crimes involving the use of force, including murder, so it cannot be used to justify traffic offences or theft as no force is involved. Duress and necessity are available for (almost) all crimes. See 2 above.

• In *Re A (Conjoined Twins)* [2001] Fam 147, permission from the High Court was sought by doctors, caring for conjoined twins (Mary and Jodie) who shared a heart, to separate them. Without the separation both twins would quickly die. Permission was sought because the inevitable consequence of the operation would be the immediate death of Mary, the twin lacking a heart.

- Without authority from the High Court the doctors were at risk of a murder conviction if they proceeded, because intentionally causing a person's death is murder
- If the operation was to be lawful it could only be because the law permits an intentional killing in such circumstances. So what was the defence?

### **Self defence**?

• Self defence is action taken **against** a **wrongdoer,** posing an unjust threat, **to repel** this threat.

Case Studies

• Jane pushes away David who is standing over her looking menacing.

• David pulls out a gun and points it at Jane. Jane defends herself by stabbing David with a kitchen knife

### Necessity?

'Necessity covers all cases where non-compliance with the law is excused by an emergency or justified by the pursuit of some greater good. In order for an accused to successfully argue a defence of necessity they must establish three points.

- First, there is the requirement of imminent peril or danger.
- Second, the accused must have had no reasonable legal alternative to the course of action he or she undertook.
- Third, there must be proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided.' Justice Dickson *Perka v Queen (1984*)
- 2 S.C.R 232

Re A (conjoined twins) tells us that necessity in its justificatory form can even justify intentional killings. This will be rare because killing an innocent person will rarely advance society's collective interests.

- Ward LJ. reasoned that separation surgery was clearly in Jodie's best interests, but not in Mary's best interests, because it denied her "inherent right to life." Given the conflict of the children's interests and the consequent conflict in the doctor's duties to each child, there was "no other way of dealing with it than by choosing the lesser of the two evils and so finding the least detrimental alternative."
- Key to the justification is that Mary was not being used as a means to an end. The death occurred as a **side effect** of a justified action (saving the life of Jodie) rather than a means to an end. It would not be lawful for doctors to kill one person and use their organs to save the lives of 6 others because this would be using the victim as a means to an end.
