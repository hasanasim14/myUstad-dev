# Mens Rea – Proving Fault

Professor William Wilson

## Learning objectives

At the end of this lecture you should be able

- To distinguish between objective and subjective fault
- To understand how the prosecution go about proving both forms of fault
- Identify crimes of subjective and objective fault by their definitional terminology
- Understand the role of judge and jury in deciding whether the prosecution have proven the fault required for an individual offence

## Subjective and objective fault

Criminal offences embrace two forms of fault, subjective and objective.

• **Subjective fault** refers to a state of the defendants mind at the time of doing the wrongful act. The prosecution have to prove that the defendant had that state of mind at the time of acting. So to gain a murder conviction or a conviction for theft or criminal damage it must prove that the accused had something in mind at the time he did the wrongful act. We call it subjective fault because (s)he him/herself (the subject) knew what (s)he was doing and still did it

## The fault element in crime

- **Some examples of crimes of subjective fault**
- **Murder** killing a person **with the intention to kill or cause serious injury**
- **Criminal damage** damaging another's property **intentionally or recklessly**
- **Handling** handling stolen goods, **knowing or believing them to be stolen**.
- **Theft –** appropriating someone's property **dishonestly intending never to return the property.**

## Subjective and objective fault

### **Objective Fault**
- A person is objectively at fault, if irrespective of what (s)he thought about what (s)he was doing/had in mind, his/her conduct does not satisfy the standards of ordinary people. The standards in other words are objective not subjective.
**Some examples of objective fault**

- careless driving,
- dangerous driving,
- gross negligence manslaughter
- rape.

## Proving fault

So how does the prosecution go about proving fault. This depends upon whether the type of fault the defendant is accused of is subjective or objective. Lets start by looking at a crime of objective fault, namely dangerous driving. As in all cases the prosecution must prove the elements of the offence by reference to all the evidence.

**Case Study on Objective Fault**

**Adam, a learner driver, is arrested following an accident in which he lost control of the car, mounted the pavement and crashed into a wall. (**based on the case of *McCrone v Riding*)

• **The judge** will direct the jury something like this.

• Members of the jury you should convict if you think that the defendant's manner of driving was dangerous in the sense it fell far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver to whom it would have been obvious, given the surrounding circumstances, that it provoked a serious risk of damage to person or property.

- **The Jury** will make its decision on the basis of what the prosecution have been able to prove about the surrounding circumstances. This will include the speed he was travelling, the road conditions, the number of pedestrians in the vicinity, the presence or otherwise of other vehicles, the time of day or night and so on.
- These are objective facts. But the important fact to note is that their assessment of whether the fault element has been established does not take account of whether Adam knew of the risks or thought he was driving dangerously or indeed whether he could be expected to do any better. Whether someone is driving dangerously or not is an objective fact which the jury, as ordinary people, can judge for themselves.

### **Subjective Fault**

• The two forms of subjective fault we are most concerned with this year are intention and recklessness. The task of the prosecution is very different and very much harder when it is faced with proving one of these types of fault. This is because, as a form of subjective fault, it is likely that the accused will simply deny having the relevant mental attitude at the time of committing the wrongdoing.

**Case Study on Subjective Fault**

**Adam sees Eve trespassing on his field about a kilometre away. He takes out his rifle, aims it at her and pulls the trigger. Is Adam guilty of murder?**

• The answer, of course, is that we don't know. We need to know what Adam was thinking at the time and he will deny intending to kill Eve.

- A typical response will find Adam saying that he intended no harm to Eve. Rather, he intended to frighten her. If the prosecution cannot disprove this claim then Adam must be acquitted of murder because what he did was consistent with frightening Eve, just as much as it is consistent with wanting to kill her. We need to look inside Adam's mind to know what he really intended.
- How can the prosecution do this? It will need to convince the jury that there is no better explanation than that he wanted to kill Eve. It will do so by reference to the evidence and it is the prosecution's task to put this evidence before the court.
- On the next slide some of the important questions which counsel for the defence and for the prosecution will put to Adam and any witnesses to supply this evidence.

Here are some of the questions counsel will ask in trying to establish what Adam had in mind when doing the shooting.

- 1. Have you ever shot at a trespasser before?
- 2. What experience do you have of firearms?
- 3. How good a marksman are you?
- 4. What calibre of gun is it and what make?
- 5. How far away was the deceased when you pulled the trigger?
- 6. Did you think you might hit her?
- 7. Did you shout any warning?
- 8. For how long did you take aim before firing?

## The Judge's directions

• Depending upon the answers to these questions, which will of course be tested in cross examination, with witnesses giving evidence in support or against Adam's account, the judge will direct the jury.

- "Members of the jury, you may convict of murder if you are sure that the accused shot the deceased intending to kill her. If you are not sure of this, then you may still find the accused guilty if you are sure he intended to cause her serious injury. If you are not sure that he had either of these intentions you should bring in a verdict of manslaughter.
- The prosecution's case is that he was angry and in the heat of the moment aimed it and fired for the purpose of killing Eve.
- The accused's case is that he did not take aim and that his intention was only to frighten the deceased. In support of that contention he claimed that he is an inexperienced marksman, his gun is very old and unreliable and that the deceased was almost a kilometre away when he pulled the trigger. You have heard witnesses who corroborate these last three contentions. Now go away to consider your verdict."

## The examination question

This case study is a cut down version of a past examination paper with all the evidence taken out. Here is the question with the evidence put back in:

• **Adam sees Eve trespassing on his field about a kilometre away. In fury, he takes out his rifle and aims it at her with a view to killing her. He knows he is unlikely to hit her since the rifle has a range of only around a kilometre, it is not a very reliable rifle and he is not a very accurate shot. The bullet, however, hits Eve and she is killed. Is Adam guilty of murder?**
