Wilson and Lammasniemi, Chapter 10 'Defences (2): affirmative defences'.

## Introduction

In contrast with failure of proof defences, affirmative defences operate outside the elements of the offence. They are also known as defences of confession and avoidance. The moral core of these defences is that the particular context within which the defendant was acting rendered their action permissible or excusable, although contrary to a criminal prohibition. In essence, they substantiate the claim that the defendant reacted reasonably, or as reasonably as could be expected in the situation in which they were placed, either to allay the unjust threat of harm or otherwise to promote the common good. The defences we shall cover in this topic are duress, duress of circumstances, necessity and self-defence. It is how these defences are distinguished which can cause difficulty.

## Mini lecture 1 - **Affirmative defences**

Prof William Wilson, Criminal law

Slide one, affirmative defenses. Distinguishing affirmative defenses and why it matters.

The three affirmative defenses, which will be examined in this lecture are duress, necessity and self-defense. It is important to be able to distinguish these defenses because on the face of it, they have a lot in common and it is easy for a student faced with a problem question involving one of these defenses to run the wrong defense.

In this slide, we can see what they have in common. Each of the defenses involved the claim that the defendant acted reasonably and proportionately in breaching a criminal prohibition to prevent an immediate or imminent threat of harm. We have seen what these defenses have in common. For our present purposes, because action taken in self-defense and under necessity are permitted by law, certain things follow.

For example, a person can use force in self-defense, although they could have retreated or called for police protection. This is not so for duress. Also, both necessity and self-defense are available to murder provided the action was reasonably necessary, not so for duress. Finally, third parties are permitted to help people using force in self-defense or necessity. Again, not so with duress.

In slide four, we shall examine a well-known case to illustrate how you analyze a case where you may be unclear which of the affirmative defenses to run. In Re A, conjoined twins in 2001, permission from the High Court was sought by doctors caring for conjoined twins Mary and Jodie, who shared a heart to separate them. Without the separation, both twins would quickly die. Permission was sought because the inevitable consequence of the operation would be the immediate death of Mary, the twin lacking a heart.

Without authority from the High Court, the doctors were at risk of a murder conviction if they proceeded because intentionally causing a person's death is murder. If the operation was to be lawful, it could only be because the law permits an intentional killing in such circumstances. What was the defense?

If the action was to be permitted, it means it was justified. There are two defenses of justification, self-defense and necessity. So it is the correct defense to run, self-defense. We saw on slide three that self-defense is action taken against a wrongdoer posing an unjust threat to repel this threat. To get a sense of what this means, take a look at the two case studies.

It is lawful for Jane to push away David if David is standing over her looking menacingly. David is acting wrongfully. He's posing an unjust threat to Jane and Jane uses force to repel this threat. Again, if David was to pull out a gun and point it at Jane, Jane is entitled to defend herself by stabbing David with a kitchen knife. David is acting wrongfully. His action is an unjust threat to Jane and Jane is using force to repel the threat. Importantly, Jane is also entitled to use such force if it is done to repel a threat made by David to a third party.

I hope you can appreciate that if the separation operation is to be lawful, it would not be because the doctors can raise a defense of self-defense or defense of others. Mary was not wrongfully posing an unjust threat to her twin, Jodie. The threat here was created by the unfortunate circumstances that the twins shared a heart and this with a threat to both of them. If the

separation then lawful because the doctors would have a defense of necessity, the first point to note is that the doctors were asking for permission to operate. This means that if the permission was granted, the operation would be lawful. That is, it would be justified not simply excusable.

Necessity operating as an excuse is called duress of circumstances and duress of circumstances is not available to murder. If the operation was lawful, it was because it was justified in the pursuit of some greater good, or as it is often expressed, in the pursuit of the lesser of two evils. This was the case here. The Court of Appeal ruled that the operation would be lawful because the three conditions of necessity were satisfied. It was better for one twin to die rather than two given that this would be the inevitable consequence of not performing the separation.

This case tells us that necessity in its justificatory form that even justify intentional killings. However, this will be very rare because killing an innocent person will rarely involve society's collective interest and will rarely be the lesser of two evils. Lord Justice Ward reasoned that separation surgery was clearly in Jodie's best interests but not in Mary's best interests because it denied her inherent right to life. Given the conflict of the children's interests and the consequent conflict in the doctor's duty to each child, there was no other way of dealing with it than by choosing the lesser of the two evils.

Why was this the lesser of two evils? Key to the justification is that Mary was not being used as a means to an end. The death occurred as a side effect of a justified action, which was saving the life of Jodie rather than a means to an end. It would not, for example, be lawful for doctors to kill one person and use the organs to save the lives of six others because this would be using the victim as a means to an end. Although you might think that this was the lesser of two evils, this is not enough, however. The right to life must be respected.

Finally, other examples of potential necessity situations in the case of murder are given in activity 11.10, which you should now tackle.


## 11.1 Relationship between the defences

It is easy to mix up the various affirmative defences as they all generally involve the claim that the defendant's action was necessary to avoid harm befalling them or someone else. It is important not to confuse them, however, not least because their scope is different. Duress, for example, is not a defence to murder, but self-defence is. A brief outline of the usual coverage of these defences follows to show their essential points of difference.

Consider the following hypothetical scenario.

### **Illustration 1**

D threatens V with death unless V helps him to beat up X.

- 1. If V succumbs to D's threat and does beat up X, he may raise the defence of duress. Obedience to the criminal law does not demand a disproportionate personal sacrifice. Note the action taken by V is a wrong committed against an innocent person, but which is excused as a concession to human frailty.
- 2. If V resists the threat and attacks D, he may raise the defence of self-defence/private defence. The law permits people to protect themselves or others from those who would harm them. Note the action taken, unlike in illustration a., is not a wrong but a justified act of self-defence against the wrongdoer.
- 3. If V escapes the threat by driving off at high speed the wrong way down a one- way street, he may raise the defence of duress of circumstances to a charge of dangerous driving. Again, the law does not demand a disproportionate personal sacrifice. Note the action taken is a wrong but this time it involves no victim. This wrong is excused as a concession to human frailty.
- 4. If V pushes X to the ground to prevent D delivering the first punch on X, he may raise the defence of necessity. The criminal law accepts the moral imperative that people, faced with a crisis demanding immediate action, may embrace the lesser of two evils, even if that evil is non-conformity to the law. Note the action taken is not a wrong but a justified act designed to advance X's good and the common good.

In short, in response to the same threat, four different possible responses are available which may act as a defence to the charge levelled against V but the defences differ. These defences will now be looked at in turn.

## 11.2 Public and private defence including self-defence

The criminal law permits the use of reasonable force for the purpose of public or private defence. Section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 (CLA 1967) provides the basic template for both public and private defence. Section 3(1) reads:

*A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large.*

Private defence, which is a subset of public defence, similarly permits the use of reasonable force in self-defence, defence of another or defence of property. To constitute defensive force, D must be acting defensively (i.e. not in retaliation or revenge) and the force used must be directed **against a person posing an unjust threat** and it must be used for the purpose of **resisting** that threat, in the case of private defence, or of preventing crime or making a lawful arrest in the case of public defence.

In *R* v *Wilkinson* [2018] EWCA Crim 2154, the appellant, a taxi driver, was convicted of false imprisonment for having returned a passenger to where he had picked her up after she had informed him she was not intending to pay. He relied upon s.3 of the CLA 1967, arguing that he had used reasonable force to prevent the passenger from committing a crime. His appeal was dismissed on two grounds. First, refusing to pay, although wrongful, was not a crime. Secondly, even if it were a crime, his use of force in taking her back to the start of the journey did not prevent that crime from occurring. In effect, his use of force was a retaliatory rather than a preventive measure. Similar reasoning informed *R* v *Demario Williams* [2020] EWCA Crim 193. The Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal against the conviction of a youth who had killed in the course of trying to recover property that had been stolen from him. The Court said that the reasonable force was justified by s.3 where it was used to prevent a crime, such as theft or robbery, from occurring. It could not be used, as here, to recover property once that robbery or theft was completed. This was not within the coverage of s.3 of the CLA 1967.

Again, it is not available as a defence to a person **resisting** a lawful arrest, since the arrest is not unjust. It is also not available to justify force used against an innocent person, such as V in Illustration 1(a) or the sacrificed twin in *Re A (conjoined twins)* [2001] Fam 147, as neither is posing an unjust threat to the other. The correct defence in the first case is duress. The correct defence in *Re A* is one of necessity.

The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 (CJIA 2008) has put some of the key common law principles on a statutory footing to ensure clarity and consistency of approach. They include a restatement of the rule that whether or not the use of force is lawful depends not on whether it was **in fact** necessary, but whether the defendant honestly believed it to be necessary. They include, also, guidelines on matters to be taken into account in deciding whether the degree of force used was reasonable. These consolidate the principles enunciated in *Beckford* [1988] AC 130. Section 76 of the CJIA 2008, as amended by the Crime and Courts Act 2013 (s.43), which applies to all cases involving the use of force in public or private defence, provides as follows:

*(3) The question whether the degree of force used by D was reasonable in the circumstances is to be decided by reference to the circumstances as D believed them to be…*

*(4) If D claims to have held a particular belief as regards the existence of any circumstances –*

*(a) the reasonableness or otherwise of that belief is relevant to the question whether D genuinely held it; but*

*(b) if it is determined that D did genuinely hold it, D is entitled to rely on it for the purposes of subsection (3), whether or not –*

- *(i) it was mistaken, or*
- *(ii) (if it was mistaken) the mistake was a reasonable one to have made.*

*(5) But subsection (4)(b) does not enable D to rely on any mistaken belief attributable to intoxication that was voluntarily induced.*

Therefore, in a case such as *Beckford*, in which the defendant claimed that he used a gun because he believed he was being shot at, the jury must be asked: first, whether D might have honestly believed that he was being shot at; and, secondly, whether, on this assumption, D's use of the gun was proportionate to the perceived threat. The jury should also be directed that, if D's belief that he was under attack was unreasonable, this would be irrelevant as a matter of law but very relevant as a matter of evidence. The more preposterous D's supposed belief, the less likely it is that he actually held it. There are two qualifications to the 'circumstances as D believed them to be' principle. If, as in *Oye*, he is suffering from an insane delusion that he is being attacked and uses force to resist that attack, D's defence is one of insanity, not self-defence. See Section 10.3.1 of this module guide.

The second qualification is provided by s.76(5). This disentitles the defendant from relying on the defence if the mistake is attributable to self-induced intoxication. So, a person who, through drink, mistakenly believes they are about to be attacked and uses force to repel the supposed attack is acting unlawfully (see the discussion of *O'Connor* at Section 10.5.1). It has been held recently that it is not necessary for the defendant to actually be intoxicated to be disentitled from relying on his mistaken belief. It is enough that the mistaken belief, as in *R* v *Taj*, was attributable to voluntary intoxication, as where recent alcohol abuse has resulted in a temporary, short-term psychotic episode. In *R* v *Taj* the defendant's long-term alcohol abuse had led to a state of psychosis that caused him to mistakenly believe V was a terrorist who was about to kill him. The Court of Appeal ruled that s.76(4)(b) applied although the defendant was not intoxicated at the time. His mistaken belief was induced by a psychosis caused by alcohol abuse and so it was attributable to voluntary intoxication. This case sits uneasily with *Oye*.

### 11.2.1 Meaning of 'reasonable force'

Subsection 76(6) of the CJIA 2008 affirmed the common law position that the degree of force used by D is not to be regarded as having been reasonable in the circumstances as D believed them to be if it was disproportionate in those circumstances. Subsection 76(6) has now been amended to provide some extra protection to householders who overreact in the terror of discovering a burglar. For householders encountering an intruder, the question is not whether the degree of force is disproportionate but whether it is reasonable, which it sometimes may be, even if disproportionate, so long as it is not 'grossly' disproportionate.

The common law provides that what is disproportionate is a question of degree. This means that the degree of force deemed reasonable varies according to the nature and degree of the threat. In *A-G's Reference (No 2 of 1983)* [1984] 2 WLR 465, it was held that a shopkeeper who armed himself with petrol bombs to protect his property from rioters was not acting disproportionately. However, a person protecting their property from thieves (*Martin* (*Anthony*) [2001] EWCA Crim 2245) or performing an arrest (*Clegg* [1995] 1 AC 482, see Section 11.3.5 below) will no doubt be acting disproportionately if they shoot to kill, but proportionately if they shoot to pre-empt a murderous attack on themself or another (*Beckford*). The case law contains the following guidance as to how to assess the reasonableness of the defender's response.

 1. Use of force must be necessary

The use of force will not be reasonable if it is not immediately necessary (on the facts as D believed them to be). If, therefore, there are other defence options available – for example, locking a door to prevent the intrusion of a burglar, the use of force may not be reasonable.

2. No duty of retreat

In *Field* [1972] Crim LR 435, D was told that V was coming round to attack him. D remained where he was and, in repelling V's attack, killed him. The prosecution case was that D's use of force was unreasonable, since he had the opportunity to retreat and seek police protection. The Court of Appeal rejected this argument and allowed the defence. People are not expected to retreat in the face of unlawful threats. They are permitted, if not expected, to hold their ground and defend themselves against those who would harm them. Contrast this with the position in regard to duress where, as we shall see, those subject to unlawful threats of violence are excused their coerced wrongdoing only if other options, such as retreat, or seeking police protection, are not available.

 3. Provoking an attack

A person is not disqualified from using reasonable force to defend themself even if they were originally at fault in provoking the attack. In *Rashford* [2005] EWCA Crim 3377, D mounted a revenge attack on V. V himself went on the attack, along with some friends. D then sought to defend himself and killed V. The Court of Appeal stated that the fact that D initially provoked the attack did not exclude his use of the defence. The defence was available so long as V's retaliation was of a nature to justify the use of force in self-defence and if the violence used was not disproportionate to the perceived threat.

 4. Pre-emptive strike

A person can make a pre-emptive strike so long as they honestly believe an attack to be imminent. This was made clear in the case of *A-G's Reference (No 2 of 1983)*, considered in Section 11.3 above. It was said that the manufacture and storage of firebombs as a protective measure could negate liability for an offence amounting, in effect, to the possession of an explosive substance for an unlawful purpose. In *Beckford* (1988), Lord Griffith made the following statement of principle:

*A man about to be attacked does not have to wait for his assailant to strike the first blow or fire the first shot; circumstances may justify a pre-emptive strike.*

 5. Reasonable force decided objectively

Whether the degree of force used is reasonable is decided objectively rather than from the defender's point of view. In deciding whether reasonable force was used, what matters is not whether D believed the amount of force used was reasonable, but whether it **was** reasonable. In deciding whether it was reasonable, the court will, however, take into account the fact that D was acting under conditions of extreme stress, and so the jury must allow that under such conditions reasonable people may make errors of judgement (*Owino* (1996)). As Lord Morris said in *Palmer* v *R* [1971] AC 814: 'Detached reflection cannot be expected in the face of an uplifted knife'.

Section 76 of the CJIA 2008 enshrines this approach. Section 76(6) provides that:

*the degree of force used by D is not to be regarded as having been reasonable in the circumstances as D believed them to be if it was disproportionate in those circumstances.*

In deciding whether it was disproportionate, s.76(7) says:

*the following considerations are to be taken into account (so far as relevant in the circumstances of the case) –*

*(a) that a person acting for a legitimate purpose may not be able to weigh to a nicety the exact measure of any necessary action; and*

*(b) that evidence of a person's having only done what the person honestly and instinctively thought was necessary for a legitimate purpose constitutes strong evidence that only reasonable action was taken by that person for that purpose.*

Notice, however, that the defender's honest and instinctive belief is only evidential. It cannot override the requirement that the degree of force used must be proportionate to the threat. In *R* v *Clegg*, a private soldier serving with the Parachute Regiment in West Belfast fired four shots into an oncoming car at a roadblock. The final shot killed a passenger in the back seat. D's defence was that he had fired because he had thought that a colleague's life was in danger. In relation to the first three shots, the judge had accepted that D may have fired in self-defence or in defence of his colleague. However, the fourth shot had been fired at the car after it had passed. It could no longer, therefore, ground the defence of self-defence, since the danger had passed. Any use of force thus became automatically unreasonable, whatever D's degree of stress and whatever he honestly and instinctively believed.

Again, in *R* v *Martin*, D shot dead a burglar because he overestimated the danger to which he was subject. He may have done so due to a psychiatric disorder. The Court of Appeal, upholding D's conviction, restated the rule that the question as to how much force is lawful is a question of law and is an objective question. D's honest assessment of the degree of force necessary was not decisive. It could not be objectively reasonable to shoot a burglar in the absence of any evidence of physical threat, however scared he was.

A similar result occurred in *Yaman* [2012] EWCA Crim 1075. The Court held that, even if it was assumed that in attacking a court-appointed locksmith with a hammer, D had mistakenly 'done what he honestly and instinctively thought was necessary' to resist a supposed burglary on the family shop, the jury must still inevitably have concluded that the force he used was excessive.

Both *Yaman* and *Martin* illustrate the kind of problems likely to arise when householders are unexpectedly confronted with an intruder. In 2013, the Government made an attempt to ensure that public perceptions of the scope of the defence corresponded with the legal underpinnings. Section 43 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 adds a new subs.(5A) to s.76 of the CJIA 2008. The effect of subs.(5A) is to apply a more flexible standard of reasonableness of reaction to the householder (e.g. Tony Martin) than for the defence generally (e.g. Private Clegg), to give **householders** 'greater latitude in terrifying or extreme situations where they may not be thinking clearly about the precise level of force that is necessary to deal with the threat faced.' (Ministry of Justice circular). Subsection 5A provides:

*In a householder case, the degree of force used by D is not to be regarded as having been reasonable in the circumstances as D believed them to be if it was grossly disproportionate in those circumstances.*

The effect of subs.(5A) is that, if householders act honestly and instinctively to protect themselves or their family from intruders using force that was reasonable in the circumstances as they saw them, they will not necessarily be guilty of an offence even if the level of force turns out to have been disproportionate in those circumstances. In *R (Collins)* v *The Secretary of State for Justice* [2016] EWHC 33 (Admin), Collins was tackled by a householder while intruding in his house. The householder put him in a headlock which caused serious injury from which Collins was not expected to recover. The question for the court was whether subs.(5A) had the effect of rendering any use of force, other than grossly disproportionate force, reasonable force. The Queen's Bench Divisional Court ruled that, while grossly disproportionate force cannot be reasonable and so is unlawful, if the force used is disproportionate without being grossly disproportionate, it may or may not be reasonable. The decision is for the jury, taking into account all the householder's circumstances. In *R* v *Ray* [2017] EWCA Crim 1391, the Court of Appeal approved this approach. Whether, despite being disproportionate, it is reasonable or not is a matter for the jury, taking into account the context and all the circumstances.

What is a householder case?

Section 76(8A) Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 as amended provides as follows:

*'a householder case' is a case where*

*(b) the force concerned is force used by D while in or partly in a building, or part of a building that is a dwelling...*

*(c) D is not a trespasser the time the force is used, and*

*(d) at that time D believed V to be in, or entering the building or part, as a trespasser.* In *R* v *Magson* [2022] EWCA Crim 1064 the Court of Appeal approved the trial judge's refusal to apply the householder defence to a person who had killed her ex partner after he had broken down the front door in response to her refusing him entrance. Key to this decision was the fact that he was still living there and so the defendant did not believe him to be a trespasser.

The Court of Appeal further clarified that householder defence applies even in cases where the defendant is involved in criminal enterprise in *R* v *Gill [2023] EWCA Crim 259*. The Court of Appeal said the trial judge was wrong to say that Gill was not entitled to the benefit of s.76(5A) because he had been involved with drugs and acted under the misapprehension that his criminal associates might be breaking into his house when in fact it was the police, executing a search warrant. At [33], the Court of Appeal said that the 'proposition that a householder loses the benefit of section 76(5A) because he has admitted to criminal acts is contrary to the rule of law, which applies to everyone, and makes no-one an outlaw'.

By subs.(8B), the definition of a householder covers people who live in dwellings and also buildings which serve a dual purpose as a place of residence and a place of work (for example, a shopkeeper and their family who live above the shop). In these circumstances, the 'householders' can rely on the more generous defence regardless of which part of the building they were in when they were confronted by an intruder.

### 11.2.2 Scope of private defence

As we have seen, self-defence is available to all crimes involving the use of force, including physical force and preemptive force. It is even a defence to murder. Some concern has been voiced in this regard in relation to the actions of law enforcement agencies, such as the police. The 'honest belief' requirement in the need to use force has, on occasions, led to dubious acquittals of police officers who shoot to kill, without taking sufficient steps to determine whether the circumstances truly demand defensive action. This seems to be contrary to Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to life and permits fatal violence for defensive purposes only if it is 'absolutely necessary'. If D shoots V, believing V to be taking out a gun from his pocket when in fact it is his identification papers, the killing is hardly 'absolutely necessary', but the 'honest belief' requirement nevertheless acquits D.

Public and private defence is only available to crimes involving the use of force. This means it is not available where the crime committed to escape an unlawful threat of harm does not involve the use of force: for example, simple driving offences and most cases of criminal damage, theft or fraud. D must therefore bring their case within another defence to avoid liability. So public defence would not be available for a person who, as a means of

bringing a fugitive to justice (public defence), paints the latter's name and address on a police station wall, since graffiti does not constitute force. It would be different if A broke a window so as to be able to defend V, who was being attacked on the other side by D, or locked D in a room to prevent D attacking V.

Here, force – breaking a window or imprisoning someone involves force – is being used for defensive purposes. Likewise a person who, in order to escape a threatened attack, drives the wrong way down a one-way street or otherwise drives dangerously cannot rely on self-defence but would need to bring their defence within the more restricted scope of duress of circumstances. It should be understood that even driving offences may be brought within the scope of private defence if they involve the use of force. So, in *R* v *Riddell* [2017] EWCA Crim 413, the defendant, having been pursued in her car by another driver and brought to a stop, sought to escape a threatened attack by nudging the pursuer aside with her car. On a charge of dangerous driving, the trial judge did not put the defence of self-defence to the jury. Instead, he directed them in relation to the defence of duress of circumstances, whose elements were less favourable to the defence. The jury convicted. The defendant's appeal was successful. What she had done in response to the perceived threat – using her car to nudge the pursuer out of the way – involved the use of force and so the defence was applicable.

#### **Study task 1**

- Read *R* v *Riddell* as well as the module Topic 11 and Wilson and Lammasniemi, Sections 10.3 'Compulsion (I): duress by threats – the legal position', 10.4 'Compulsion (II): duress of circumstances' and 10.8 'Purposes for which reasonable force may be used'. Identify how duress of circumstances is a more challenging defence to raise successfully than self-defence.
- Read Topic 11 and Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 10.7.A.4 'What counts as force?'. Discover or invent an example of how a person might raise the defence of self-defence to a charge of criminal damage.

#### Mini lecture 2 - DURESS

Duress, necessity, and self-defense are true or affirmative defenses. In each case, the defendant's claim to avoid punishment is that he acted reasonably in the circumstances. In this mini lecture, we will look at duress.

Duress was defined by Lord Lane in Graham as follows: "Was the accused or may he have been, impelled to act as he did because as a result of what he reasonably believed to be the situation, he feared that otherwise death or serious injury would result. Second, if so, would a sober person of reasonable firmness, sharing the characteristics of the accused, have responded to the situation by acting as the accused did?"

There are two possible sources of the threat - duress by threats and duress of circumstances. With duress by threats, the threats issued from a wrongdoer, and the wrongdoer nominates the crime in the form, "Do this or else." With duress of circumstances, D is faced with an external peril to escape which D commits a crime of his own choosing. For example, in *Hasan*, the defendants were living under the threat of death and torture in an oppressive state. They hijacked a plane to escape this threat. The Court of Appeal held that the defense of duress of circumstances was available.

We're now turning to examine the element of duress. The first element is that threats of serious injury or death are required. Nothing less than this will do. For example, in *Valderama Vega* in 1985, the threat of exposing the defendant's homosexuality was not enough. In *Quayle*, the defendant was suffering from severe pain due to a leg amputation. It was held that this did not permit Quayle to self-administer marijuana for the purpose of pain relief. Severe pain is not the same as threats of serious injury.

The threat must be a threat to D, or one of his family or close circle, or, to someone for whom D would reasonably regard himself as responsible.

How far does this class extend? Consider the case on the slide. X commands D, a taxi driver, to drive him and his gang to Wilton Bank where they are to execute a robbery. He tells D that if he does not do so, he will kill, at random, an infant child at 10:00 AM the next day. D does as commanded.

Can D rely on the defense of duress? The answer is, only if the unknown child is someone for whom D would reasonably regard himself as responsible. Is he? Well, there's no right answer to this question. It will be for the judge to decide. However, a person for whom D would reasonably regard himself as responsible withheld in *R v SL* to include members of the public where a factory hide an unlicensed security firm in breach of the law as a protection against possible terrorist attacks, which would put parcels by at risk.

The third element in duress is that the defendant's view of the facts should be reasonably entertained. Duress is an excuse. This means that the court will only allow the defense if he considers that commission of the crime was a reasonable reaction to the threat. It will not be, if the defendant had no reasonable grounds, for believing they were being threatened with death or serious injury. If in the previous example, the taxi driver had simply been told, "Drive us, else you

might live to regret it." The judge might well disallow the defense if he or she thought that this did not give the defendant reasonable grounds for thinking that his life was in danger.

Another requirement which shows that excuses are grounded in the fact that the defendant's reaction was reasonable is that they must display reasonable standards of fortitude in the face of threats. The law requires the jury to consider whether given the characteristics of the defendant, a sober person of reasonable firmness would respond as the defendant did. The old and frail are expected to have lower standards of fortitude than the young and vigorous, but a person cannot rely on their cowardice, weakness of character, or mental illness to excuse their capitulation to the threat.

Again, reasonable people faced with threats to their safety take evasive action if this is available. In *Hasan*, the leading case, the House of Lords ruled that the defense was not available unless the defendant reasonably apprehended immediate or almost immediate death or serious injury for failure to comply. If this were not the case, the defendant would be expected to take evasive action, including seeking police protection.

The next element is that D cannot rely on threats to which he has voluntarily laid himself open. A person who consults with a criminal gang, either as a gang member or as a customer, as in the case of drug addicts, is expected to know that he might be at risk of coercion, and so is disabled from excusing himself for succumbing to the gang's threats.

To help along your understanding, take a look at these two illustrations. Illustration one is a case of duress by threats. The form is, "Do this or else." In this case, Adam nominates the crime to be committed by Eve. The second illustration is an example of duress of circumstances. Eve is faced with an external peril to escape, which Eve commits a crime of her own choosing. The law of duress is the same whichever form of duress is pleaded.

Finally, exclusions. Duress is not available to murder or attempted murder. It is available to all other crimes. In this exclusion, it parts company with self-defense and necessity, both of which may be available for murder if all other requirements are met, in *Howe* it was confirmed that duress was not available for murder, even where the defendant was only an accomplice, for example, with the driver of the getaway car.

## 11.3 Duress

### 11.3.1 General matters

Duress is a rather unusual defence, in that it involves the claim that it may be excusable to follow the commands of a wrongdoer rather than the state, and that it may be excusable to victimise an innocent person to save one's own skin. This has led some commentators to argue for its abolition. The strategy adopted by the criminal law is to put restrictions upon its application. Reasonableness of reaction is of the essence for this defence, since it is one of the criminal law's few concessions to human frailty. In describing the defence, Murnaghan J in *A-G* v *Whelan* [1934] IR 518 (Irish CCA) said that:

*...threats of immediate death or serious personal violence so great as to overbear the ordinary powers of human resistance should be accepted as a justification for acts which would otherwise be criminal.*

There are two forms of duress: **duress by threats** and **duress of circumstances**. In duress by threats, D is coerced into committing an unlawful act by the threats of a wrongdoer. In duress of circumstances, D is compelled to commit an unlawful act to avoid a threat of harm posed by external circumstances.

#### **Illustration 2**

- a. X puts a gun to the head of D, a taxi driver, and says 'Get me to the airport in five minutes or I kill you'. D exceeds the speed limit in acceding to this demand.
- b. D notices that the driver in the car behind him has lost consciousness. At any moment, the out-of-control car will crash into D's car at high speed. D goes through a red traffic light in order to avoid the crash.

In the first case, D may rely on the defence of duress by threats. In the second case, D's defence is one of duress of circumstances. The rules governing the two forms of duress are identical.

The basic principles governing duress were expounded in *Graham* [1982] 1 WLR 294. These were subsequently approved by the House of Lords in *Howe* [1987] AC 417 and held applicable also to duress of circumstances in *Martin* [1989] 1 All ER 652. In *Graham*, the defendant lived in a *ménage à trois* with W, his wife, and K, his homosexual lover. One night, after D and K had been drinking heavily, K put a lighting flex round W's neck and then commanded D to pull at the other end. D did so and his wife was strangled. Both D and K were charged with murder. D pleaded not guilty, claiming that his action was coerced by his fear of K. Although the judge allowed the defence to go to the jury, it convicted D of murder. The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction. Lord Lane CJ proposed the following model direction as guidance to the jury:

*Was the accused, or may he have been, impelled to act as he did because as a result of what he reasonably believed to be the situation he feared that otherwise death or serious injury would result; second, if so, would a sober person of reasonable firmness, sharing the characteristics of the accused, have responded to the situation by acting as the accused did?*

### 11.3.2 Duress by threats

These principles have suffered significant elaboration more recently by the House of Lords in the case of *Hasan* [2005] UKHL 22. In this case, in which the defendant pleaded duress arising from threats made by X, a violent man with whom he had a criminal association, in answer to his trial for aggravated burglary, Lord Bingham placed the following restrictions upon its application as a defence. It seems likely that these principles, with the possible exception of 2., apply equally to duress of circumstances.

- 1. The threat or danger must be of death or serious injury.
- 2. The threat must be directed against the defendant, his or her immediate family or someone close to the defendant.
- 3. The relevant tests are in general objective, with reference to the reasonableness of the defendant's perceptions and conduct.
- 4. The defence is available only where the criminal conduct which it is sought to excuse has been directly caused by the threats relied upon.
- 5. There must have been no evasive action the defendant could reasonably have been expected to take.
- 6. The defendant must not voluntarily have laid themself open to the duress relied upon.
- 7. Duress may be a defence to any crime except some forms of treason, murder and attempted murder.
- 1. The threat or danger must be of death or serious injury.

The essence of this defence is that the defendant's actions were morally involuntary, and only threats of death or serious injury remove the element of free choice. So, in *Valderrama-Vega* [1985] Crim LR 220, the Court of Appeal ruled that the threat of exposing D's homosexuality was not enough to raise the defence. Similarly, the Court of Appeal in *Quayle* [2005] EWCA Crim 1415 ruled that duress of circumstances was not an answer to a charge under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 for a defendant who claimed he had consumed cannabis to combat severe neurological pain following a leg amputation. Severe pain does not amount to serious injury.

One extremely significant qualification to this restriction was made in *A (RJ)* [2012] EWCA Crim 434, where it was stated *obiter* that a credible threat of rape could ground the defence of duress or duress of circumstances.

2. The threat must be directed against the defendant, his or her immediate family or someone for whom the defendant reasonably regards himself as being responsible

Duress is not limited to cases where the defendant is the subject of the threats. It also applies where his or her partner (*Hurley* v *Murray* [1967] VR 526), spouse or family is the subject (*Ortiz* (1986) 83 Cr App R 173). Until *Hasan*, there was **no** strong authority for the proposition that the availability was limited to those with a close personal connection to the defendant. In *Shayler* [2001] EWCA Crim 1977, the defendant, a member of the security services, in passing documents to journalists breached the Official Secrets Act which, it was alleged, he had done in order to safeguard members of the public. At a preliminary hearing, the judge ruled that the defence of duress of circumstances was not available to Shayler. His appeal was dismissed on the ground that he was unable to pinpoint with any degree of precision what the threats to security might involve or who was at risk. Lord Woolf limited the application of the defence to cases where:

*a defendant commits an otherwise criminal act to avoid an imminent peril of danger to life or serious injury to himself or towards somebody for whom he reasonably regards himself as being responsible.*

Lord Woolf included among that class not merely members of the defendant's close circle but also cases where:

*he is placed in a position where he is required to make a choice whether to take or not to take the action which it is said will avoid them being injured. Thus if the threat is to explode a bomb in a building if the defendant does not accede to what is demanded the defendant owes responsibility to those who would be in the building if the bomb exploded.*

It is clear that this class of subjects is far wider than that proposed by Lord Bingham in *Hasan*, and – for the reasons given by Lord Woolf – rightly so. An emergency is no less an emergency for the fact that the individuals threatened are not known personally to the defendant.

#### **Study task 2**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 10.3.B and answer the following questions

A tells B on the day of the trial that if he does not perjure himself C, A's gang member, has been given instruction to select and kill an unidentified child. Assuming B commits perjury, what problem will the defence have in raising the defence of duress? What argument would you make to advance the defence's case?

 Show feedback

The argument I would make is simple. A threat such as this is no less real for it being directed against an unknown person and, as fellow human beings we all have a responsibility to do what is reasonable to prevent harm occurring to other humans. This argument may well not succeed but it is probably the best there is.

3. The relevant tests are in general objective, with reference to the reasonableness of the defendant's perception and conduct

*Hasan* confirms Lord Lane CJ's statement in *Graham* that if D acts under a mistaken belief that he, or someone for whom he is responsible, has been threatened with death or serious injury, the mistake will not avail him unless it is reasonable. Compare self-defence on this point. The decision in *Shayler*, for example, could equally have been decided on the ground that there was no plausible case appearing in the leaked documents that members of the public were at imminent risk of death or serious injury. D may have believed they were but the belief was not held on reasonable grounds.

In *A (RJ)* [2012] EWCA Crim 434, the defendant was convicted of the offence of perverting the course of justice when she falsely retracted allegations of rape against her husband. She did so, apparently, in the belief that she would suffer serious injury by her husband if she did not. This fear was real but not based on reasonable grounds since no threat of violence had been made to her when she made the false retractions on which her prosecution was founded.

The criminal law does not give *carte blanche* to a person threatened with death or serious injury to commit any crime demanded of them. Indeed, as we shall see, duress is never a defence to murder or attempted murder, however powerful the threats. But, more generally, a reasonable balance must be struck between the threat posed to the defendant and the crime they must commit to avoid the threat. Although D is faced with a threat of death or grievous bodily harm, it may still be necessary for them to do their legal duty. Although there is authority for the proposition that duress of circumstances may be an answer to a charge of hijacking an aircraft (*Abdul Hussain* [1999] Crim LR 570), it might be that the jury concludes that participating in this crime is not objectively reasonable, however serious the threats.

As *Graham* provides, moreover, reasonable standards of courage are required. In deciding whether the defendant did display the standards of fortitude of reasonable people, it will not avail D to claim that they were a congenital coward. So, in *Hegarty* [1994] Crim LR 353, the defendant pleaded duress to a charge of robbery and possession of a firearm. He claimed that he had been threatened with violence against his family if he refused. The court refused to allow medical evidence that D was 'emotionally unstable' and in a 'grossly elevated neurotic state' to

vary the standards of fortitude to be expected of him, which were objective. And in *Bowen* [1997] 1 WLR 372, the defendant's very low level of intelligence was similarly ignored on the basis that reasonable courage can be expected of everyone, including those with severe learning difficulties.

However, some characteristics of the defendant, which may affect the levels of fortitude to be expected of reasonable people, may be taken into account, so long as they are consistent with a coherent notion of a reasonable person. The legal position is summed up in the following statement of principle by Stuart Smith LJ in *Bowen*:

*The mere fact that the defendant is more pliable, vulnerable, timid or susceptible to threats than a normal person is not a characteristic with which it is legitimate to invest the reasonable/ordinary person for the purpose of considering the objective test… The defendant may be in a category of persons whom the jury may think less able to resist pressure than people not within that category. Obvious examples are age, where a young person may well not be so robust as a mature one; possibly sex, though many women would doubtless consider they had as much moral courage to resist pressure as men; pregnancy, where there is added fear for the unborn child; serious physical disability, which may inhibit self-protection…*

One further qualification needs to be made with respect to this rather rigorous restriction; namely, that where a reasonable person has been reduced, through trauma such as cumulative domestic violence or rape (*Sewell* [2004] EWCA Crim 2322), to a condition of 'learned helplessness', and so unable to resist the threats of their abuser, this should be taken into account. Society cannot expect reasonable people to be steadfast in the face of unremitting physical and mental abuse.

4. The defence is available only where the criminal conduct which it is sought to excuse has been directly caused by the threats relied upon

It is not enough that the defendant was threatened with death or serious injury for non-compliance with the threat; they must execute or participate in the crime because of the threat. If D would have committed the crime anyway, the defence is unavailable. In *Valderrama* [1985] Crim LR 220, for example, the defendant was threatened both with exposure as a homosexual and threats to himself and his family if he did not smuggle cocaine. The Court of Appeal said that if D had committed the offence solely because of the threat to expose him as a homosexual, then he would not be able to rely on duress, even though he had also been threatened with death. However, if he had committed the offence at least in part due to the latter threat, the defence would be available.

5. There must have been no evasive action the defendant could reasonably have been expected to take

Consistent with the requirement that D's participation in the offence must be an objectively reasonable means of allaying a threat of death or serious injury, the defence is not available if it could have been avoided, whether by escaping the coercer or seeking police protection. This contrasts with the position in self-defence. So, in *Gill* [1963] 1 WLR 841, D was convicted of the theft of his employer's lorry. The Court of Appeal held that duress was not available where the defendant had been left alone outside his employer's yard, which he was due to rob, and therefore was well able to raise the alarm and escape the threat.

In *Hudson and Taylor* [1971] 2 QB 202, the Court of Appeal was not so exacting. The defendants were teenage girls who were prosecution witnesses in the trial of certain gang members. The gang threatened to 'cut them up' if they did not perjure themselves in court. They pleaded duress. The trial judge refused to allow the defence, since the threat could hardly have been carried out immediately in open court. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, agreeing that seeking police protection was not always reasonably to be expected.

In *Hasan*, the House of Lords has now abandoned this relaxed approach to the requirement of urgency in duress. Lord Bingham, disapproving *Hudson and Taylor*, insisted that the defence was not available unless D reasonably apprehended immediate or almost immediate death or serious injury for failure to comply. If this were not the case, D would be expected to take evasive action.

6. The defendant must not voluntarily have laid themself open to the duress relied upon Intoxication

Once again, this requirement is a qualification of the general requirement of reasonableness which hedges round the defence. There are two aspects to this qualification. First, as *Graham* provides, loss of moral fortitude due to the effects of voluntary intoxication cannot be relied upon. The jury should be told to disregard any evidence of the defendant's intoxicated state when assessing whether they acted under duress. The reasonable person is sober and steadfast, not drunk and out of control. This does not prevent the defendant from raising evidence of intoxication to negate *mens rea*. Defence counsel did not present such an argument in *Graham*.

#### Voluntary subjection to the risk of coercion

The defence is also denied to those who voluntarily place themselves at risk of coercion. This is another example of the doctrine of prior fault. In *Sharpe* [1987] QB 853, the defendant joined a criminal gang. He later participated in a robbery on a Post Office, in which a sub-postmaster was killed. D's defence to manslaughter was duress: he claimed that he had undertaken the robbery only because he had a gun to his head. The defence was rejected on the basis that D voluntarily joined the gang, knowing that coercion might later be brought to bear to commit an

offence. In *Hasan* [2005] UKHL 22, the House of Lords stated that the defendant is disqualified from relying on the defence not only where they actually foresee that violence may be used to exact compliance, but also where they should reasonably know that it may be.

The rule applies equally where the defendant voluntarily runs the risk of coercion outside the scope of a criminal organisation. In *Heath* [2000] Crim LR 109, a drug user who was coerced into supplying a class B drug by his own supplier, whom he had not paid, was denied the defence on the basis that he should have known the risks of mixing with drug dealers. A similar decision was reached in *Mullally* [2012] EWCA Crim 687.

7. Duress may be a defence to any crime except some forms of treason, murder and attempted murder Until fairly recently, duress could be raised in answer to a charge of murder, but only where the defendant was an accessory to, rather than perpetrator of, the murder. This was the outcome of *DPP for Northern Ireland* v *Lynch* [1975] AC 653, in which the defendant, as driver, had participated in the murder of a police officer by the IRA. D's defence was duress, claiming the coercer would have shot him if he did not comply. The trial judge disallowed the defence and the Court of Appeal dismissed D's appeal. The House of Lords, underlining the rationale of the defence as a concession to human frailty, allowed the appeal. Lord Morris, explaining the decision, said:

*any rational system of law should take fully into account the standards of honest and reasonable men. By those standards it is fair that actions and reactions may be tested. If then someone is really threatened with death or serious injury unless he does what he is told to do is the law to pay no heed to the miserable, agonising plight of such a person? For the law to understand not only how the timid but also the stalwart may in a moment of crisis behave is not to make the law weak but to make it just. In the calm of the court- room measures of fortitude or of heroic behaviour are surely not to be demanded when they could not in moments for decision reasonably have been expected even of the resolute and the well-disposed.*

*In posing the case where someone is 'really' threatened I use the word 'really' in order to emphasise that duress must never be allowed to be the easy answer of those who can devise no other explanation of their conduct nor of those who readily could have avoided the dominance of threats nor of those who allow themselves to be at the disposal and under the sway of some gangster-tyrant…The law would be censorious and inhumane which did not recognise the appalling plight of a person who perhaps suddenly finds his life in jeopardy unless he submits and obeys.*

In *Howe* [1987] AC 417, two appellants, H and B, were coerced by X into torturing and murdering a young man. The House of Lords dismissed their appeals against conviction and, overruling *Lynch*, said that it could be used neither by the principal nor the accessory. Lord Hailsham LC, ignoring the 'human frailty' basis of the defence, made it an issue rather of moral reasonableness. A reasonable person does not kill another to save their own skin, a principle which had earlier been used in the necessity case of *Dudley and Stephens* (1884) 14 QBD 273:

*[In the case] where the choice is between the threat of death or… serious injury and deliberately taking an innocent life… a reasonable man might reflect that one innocent human life is at least as valuable as his own or that of his loved one. In such a case a man cannot claim that he is choosing the lesser of two evils. Instead he is embracing the cognate but morally disreputable principle that the end justifies the means.*

In *Gotts* [1992] 2 AC 412, the restriction was extended to attempted murder. In this case, D was coerced by his father into helping him to kill his mother. The Court of Appeal ruled that the defence of duress was not available. It has been decided, however, that duress is an answer to conspiracy to murder (*Ness* [2011] EWCA Crim 3105).

#### **Study task 3**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 10.3.F 'Scope of the defence'.

- 1. If D intentionally commits grievous bodily harm to V under coercion D is entitled to raise the defence. If V happens to die due to poor medical treatment, D will be charged with murder and so will not be able to raise the defence. Is this coherent?
- 2. If not, should duress be withdrawn from s.18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861?

### 11.3.3 Duress of circumstances

In 1986, the defence of duress was allowed in a number of cases involving dangerous driving and other driving offences, although the crime to be committed was not nominated by the wrongdoer; it was nominated by the driver himself as a means of escaping the wrongdoer's threat of death or serious injury. In *Willer* (1986) 83 Cr App R 225, duress was allowed as an answer to a charge of reckless driving when D drove through a pedestrian precinct to escape from a gang threatening violence to him and his passengers. This was not, in itself, a substantial departure from precedent. After all, there is little difference between A saying to V 'drive through this pedestrian precinct or else I shoot you' and A threatening to shoot V, in response to which A drives off through a pedestrian precinct. If the one excuse is available, the other should be too.

A similar decision was reached in *Conway* [1989] QB 290, except that here D mistakenly believed he was being attacked by a gang when in fact they were plain-clothes police officers trying to arrest his passenger. You will remember that the defence remains available even if D is mistaken as to the facts, so long as the mistake is reasonable.

*Martin* [1989] 1 All ER 652 was the first case in which it was explicitly recognised that duress of circumstances was a separate form of the defence, in which it was not necessary to show that the defendant acted so as to escape the threats of a person bent on killing or causing serious injury to them or a companion. Here, D drove his stepson, who had overslept, to work, although he was a disqualified driver. D had been told by his wife that if he did not do so the stepson would lose his job and she would commit suicide. The Court of Appeal ruled that the trial judge was wrong in not allowing the defence of duress of circumstances to be put to the jury.

In *Pommell* [1995] 2 Cr App R 607, the defence was made available for the first time to a case not involving a driving offence. D was charged and convicted of being in possession of a loaded machine gun. D claimed that he had taken possession of it to prevent the owner shooting to kill and was intending to take it to the police the next day. In *S and L* [2009] EWCA Crim 85, duress of circumstances was ruled available to a charge of employing unlicensed security guards as a means of addressing the risk of a terrorist attack on premises which abutted a public highway.

**Note 1:** The cases dealt with above all involved 'crimes without victims' – i.e. no one was victimised by the defendant's decision to escape danger by breaking the law. Does it operate where an innocent person is victimised? In *R* v *Petgrave* [2018] EWCA Crim 1397, the Court of Appeal affirmed that it would in a case where the defendant was charged with causing serious injury by dangerous driving, contrary to s.1A of the Road Traffic Act 1988, when he had mounted the pavement and injured the victim in trying to escape from a dangerous gang.

**Note 2**: *Pommel*, *Martin* and *S and L*, to a greater extent than *Conway* and *Willer*, involved subtle changes to the conceptual DNA of the defence of duress. The defendant is not merely saying 'I broke the law to escape D causing me or someone else serious injury' but rather 'I did it because it was the lesser of two evils. If I had not broken the law a worse evil would have occurred.' In other words, it transcends the usual rationale for duress, which is that it acts as a concession to human frailty. It takes on the trappings of a partial justification rather than a mere excuse and begins to transmute into a defence of necessity.

## 11.4 Necessity

he potential scope of necessity was described in the Canadian case of *Perka* v *Queen* (1984) 13 DLR (4th), where it was stated that:

*Necessity covers all cases where non-compliance with the law is excused by an emergency or justified by the pursuit of some greater good.*

### 11.4.1 Necessity as an excuse

The recognition of the defence of duress of circumstances was in effect a recognition of a general defence of necessity, a defence which had long been resisted by the criminal courts. In fact, *Petgrave* notwithstanding, there is little in present case law to suggest that duress of circumstances will develop to embrace the same coverage as duress by threats. As we know, duress by threats is an answer even to crimes of violence where an innocent person is victimised. Duress of circumstances, by contrast, has usually been applied in so-called victimless crimes. Indeed, the leading case on necessity (*Dudley and Stephens* (1884)) explicitly rejected any defence of necessity which would permit 'the killing of an innocent to save one's own skin'. As a result, two shipwrecked sailors, who killed and ate the cabin boy after days adrift in an open boat, had no answer to a charge of murder.

By extension, it was this case and this principle which Lord Hailsham relied upon in *Howe* to disallow the defence of duress by threats in cases of murder. Until *Willer* and *Conway*, the courts, using *Dudley and Stephens* as authority, consistently refused to allow this 'lesser of two evils' defence. There were two reasons given for this. The first, as illustrated by *Dudley and Stephens* itself, was that it would introduce the potential for individual rights to be overridden by collective interests. If those defendants had a defence, would it not also afford a defence to doctors and others who effected forced blood transfusions or organ transplants if this accorded with the balance of evils?

The second reason is that such a defence would subvert the rule of law, since it could, in effect, allow individuals to ignore their legal duty in the pursuit of some supposedly greater good. On balance, it might be considered better to allow the state to sort out problems needing solution rather than leaving it to individual choice. So, in *Buckoke* v *GLC* [1971] Ch 655, the Court of Appeal held that it was no answer to a charge of jumping a red traffic light that the driver was in a fire engine answering an emergency. And in *Southwark LBC* v *William*s [1971] Ch 734, it was no answer to trespass that the trespassers were homeless and the building unoccupied. In this case, Lord Denning gave a classic illustration of a 'floodgates' argument in the context of the threat to the rule of law posed by a potential defence of necessity:

*…if hunger were once allowed to be an excuse for stealing, it would open a way through which all kinds of disorder and lawlessness would pass…If homelessness were once admitted as a defence to trespass, no one's house could be safe. Necessity would open a door which no man could shut. It would not only be those in extreme need who would enter. There would be others who would imagine that they were in need, or would invent a need, so as to gain entry.*

The real significance of the acceptance of the defence of duress of circumstances must be considered in the light of this statement, since it provides an answer to Lord Denning's concerns and is consistent with Lord Hailsham's restriction on the defence. The defence is limited to cases of emergency, when something has to be done immediately to prevent harm and there is no opportunity to seek guidance or state protection. And it is limited to cases where the harm threatened is of death or serious injury. The defendant, in other words, is not simply choosing a breach of the law as the lesser of two evils: rather, the nature of the emergency gives him no choice.

The statement in *Perka*, setting out the scope of the defence of necessity, is only partly covered by duress of circumstances, since the latter does not legitimate action taken in defiance of a criminal prohibition simply because it would be the lesser of two evils. Applied to a case such as *Buckoke* v *GLC*, a defence is now available if the fire engine jumped the red traffic lights in the reasonable belief that it was necessary to prevent loss of life, but it would remain unlawful to do so simply to facilitate the putting out of the fire and thus reduce the extent of fire damage and the resources necessary to effect this.

### 11.4.2 Necessity as a justification

The justificatory form of necessity outlined in *Perka* has now been accepted by the courts in one restricted context, namely medical intervention. There is a good reason for this – that if the case is not an emergency, doctors generally have the ability to secure legal authority for their action by an application to the High Court.

The first case of this nature was *Re F* [1990] 2 AC 1. Doctors in a mental hospital sought a declaration that it would be lawful for them to perform a sterilisation operation on a mentally incompetent (female) patient who had formed a sexual relationship with a fellow patient. The House of Lords concluded that it was in her overall 'best interests' for the operation to proceed on a balance of all her interests, including her interest in remaining free from the physical and psychological effects of pregnancy, abortion or childbirth on the one hand, and her interest in having procreative capacity and remaining free from surgical interference on the other. Lord Goff, for the House of Lords, underlined its justificatory nature by stating that it was not of the essence that there be some emergency requiring immediate action, although in many cases this would be present. Operations and other interventions may be justified even if performed for other than clinical reasons. He said:

*these might include such humdrum matters as routine medical or dental treatment, even simple care such as dressing and undressing and putting to bed.*

The availability of the defence does not, however, depend upon authority being sought. In *Bournewood* [1999] 1 AC 458, the defence was allowed *ex post fact*o to justify the detention of a patient suffering a mental disorder and whose condition posed a potential threat to himself and others.

These cases were not exceptional on the facts, since they involved mentally incompetent patients whose wellbeing, it was supposed, depended upon the availability of such a defence. In other words, their human rights were supposedly being advanced, rather than trampled on, by the defence. The defence does not, however, justify doctors acting contrary to a competent patient's express wishes: for example, performing a life-saving caesarean section (*St George's Healthcare NHS Trust* v *S* [1998] 3 All ER 673) or leg amputation (*Re C* [1994] 1 All ER 819) on a patient who refuses consent.

In *Re A (Conjoined Twins)* [2001] Fam 147, the defence of necessity was used to justify an operation to separate conjoined twins who shared a heart. The necessity for the operation was that without it, both twins would quickly die. The problem, however, was that the inevitable consequence of the operation would be the immediate death of the twin lacking a heart and that was hardly in her best interests! Would the proposed operation be lawful in the light of this? Doctrine holds that intentional acts calculated to produce certain death is murder, and duress of circumstances is no defence to murder. If necessity was to operate as a defence here, therefore, it would have to be, like self-defence, in its justificatory form. Brooke LJ (at 1052) explicitly adopted the justificatory lesser of two evils basis for the defence in the following statement of principle. The defence would be limited to cases where:

- the act is needed to avoid inevitable and irreparable evil
- no more should be done than is reasonably necessary for the purpose to be achieved, and
- the evil inflicted must not be disproportionate to the evil avoided.

This is a very important case because it indicates that necessity as a justification operates, in the right context, as a defence even to murder if the balance of evils equation is satisfied. Looking more closely at *Re A (Conjoined Twin*s), the context was the fact that the killing was a side-effect of an otherwise entirely proper action rather than, as in *Dudley and Stephens*, a means to an end. This indicates the defence would not justify, for example, killing a terminally ill patient to provide organs for others who would die without them, or even a forcible blood transfusion with the same object. Looked at in this way, it is possible that the defence of necessity may well be applicable

outside the medical arena to cases where the only way to prevent loss of life is to take action which, incidentally, causes others to die. In the following activity we can see some illustrations of the kind of contexts which may elicit such a conclusion.

## Sample examination question 1

**Question**

(Tutor Feedback Activity 2022)

*'Acting reasonably, in the circumstances which prevailed at the time of acting, is the central ethical core of all criminal defences.'*
**Discuss.**

*Tutor guidance*

- 1. Acting reasonably is a core element in affirmative defences duress, necessity, self-defence, loss of control.
- 2. Its centrality differs according to the nature of the defence:
  - Duress requires reasonableness both in regard to the defendant's perception of the necessity to act as commanded and reasonable standards of courage and level of response. The Hasan criteria all, in different degrees, underpin this general requirement.
  - Self-defence requires reasonable levels of force but permits unreasonable mistakes as to the necessity for action (s.76). The circumstances which prevailed are taken into account in the former respect especially the 'heat of the moment', e.g. *Palmer* (s.76(7) CJA and the householder cases, s.76(5)(a) CJA but do not override the basic principle, e.g. *Collins, Ray*.
  - Necessity, in its excuse form of duress of circumstances see (a) above. In its justificatory form reasonableness is of the essence whether the context is viewed as a patient's best interests calculation, e.g. *Re F* or a 'lesser of two evils' calculation, e.g. *Re A (conjoined* twins), *Pipe*.
  - Loss of control is predicated upon the defendant acting unreasonably, that is, losing the ability to be guided by reason s.54 CJA. However, both the requirement that there be a qualifying trigger (s.55) and s.54(1) demand that the reaction be within the limits of social tolerance or partially justified, implying an acceptance that even reasonable people may lose their cool if the conditions are right, e.g. *Clinton* cf. *Asmelash*.
- 3. Failure of proof defences are not premised on reasonableness of action or reaction. By contrast they are premised on the absence of reason. This can be seen reflected in key elements of the McNaghten Rules, e.g. *Bratty*, *Sullivan, Broome* and *Hennessy* and is central also to automatism, which requires a disconnection between conduct and a controlling (rational) mind (e.g. *Bratty*, *Quick*, *R* v *T*). Even for this latter defence, a failure to act reasonably may disqualify the defendant from relying on the defence if reasonable behaviour would have prevented it, e.g. *Bailey*, *Lipman*, *Rigby*, *Watmore* v *Jenkins*.
