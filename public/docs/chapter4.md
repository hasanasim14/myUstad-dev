### Introduction

Most of the crimes we examine in **Criminal law** require proof that D caused a particular harm, for example injury or death to the victim or damage to their property. So how do the prosecution go about proving that D (or rather D's act) was the cause? For example, if A threatens B with death if he does not punch C, and B does punch C, is it A or B who causes C's injury? Or if A stabs V and V is killed in a car crash on the way to hospital is it A or the car crash which causes V's death? The principles governing causation are the subject of this chapter.

**Core text**
- Wilson, Chapter 5 'Causation'.

**page 37**

### 4.1 Result crimes**

The third element in *actus reus* concerns result crimes only. You will remember that some crimes do not require proof of harm. These are known as conduct crimes. They require proof only of some form of wrongful conduct. An example is dangerous driving; a person can be convicted of dangerous driving if, for example, they drive too fast or aggressively, ignore traffic lights or road signs, or overtake while driving round a blind corner. A conviction does not require anybody to be hurt or for there to be an accident.

Result crimes, however, require **both** wrongful conduct **and** harm. So the crime of causing death by dangerous driving requires **both** dangerous driving **and** a death. Crucially, however, the prosecution must also prove causation. In other words, it must prove that the victim met their death **as a result** of the defendant driving dangerously.

For all result crimes, therefore, the prosecution bears the burden of proving that the defendant's conduct caused the prohibited result. In murder or manslaughter this will be the death; in criminal damage it will be the damage done to the property; in malicious wounding it will be the wound, and so on. In this chapter we consider what the prosecution has to show if it is to discharge its burden of proving causation.

In the vast majority of cases this will be straightforward. For example, if A shoots B with a gun and B dies from blood loss, it should not be too difficult for the prosecution to show that A's act caused B's death. Similarly, if A sets light to B's house or stabs B, it should not be too difficult for the prosecution to show that A's act caused the criminal damage or the wound, as the case may be.

The prosecution's task becomes harder, however, when more than one event or act contributes to the result. In such circumstances questions as to whether D's act or omission was the cause of the harm demand the application of legal principles. So what are the principles governing causation in the criminal law? Before we investigate further, consider the following cases in which such principles will need to be deployed.

#### **Activity 4.1**

**Review the following cases. When you have done so, answer the questions at the end.**

- a. D, as a joke, places a wet bar of soap on the floor of V's bathroom, hoping that V will slip on the soap. V does slip on the soap, hits her head on the floor and is knocked unconscious. Does D cause V's injury?**
- b. As above, except that V dies because her skull was unusually thin. Does D cause V's death?**
- c. D rapes V. So distressed is V that she commits suicide. Does D cause V's death?**
- d. D rapes V. When V's father finds out he kills V due to the dishonour caused to the family by V's loss of virginity. Does D cause V's death?**
- e. D stabs V. An ambulance is called to take V to hospital. On the journey to hospital the ambulance is involved in an accident which kills the driver, X, and V. Does D cause V's death?**
- f. D is the lifeguard on a beach. She sees V struggling in the water and dives in to save him. Unfortunately D is not a good swimmer and is unable to rescue V in time. Does D cause V's death?**
- g. D stabs V. An ambulance is called to take V to hospital. The ambulance crew are on their lunch break and refuse to come until it has ended. By the time they arrive, V has died of blood loss. Does D cause V's death?**
- h. D and V attend a party together. D gives V an ecstasy pill which V takes. Unknown to both D and V the pill has unusual strength. V falls unconscious and dies almost immediately. Does D cause V's death?**

**page 38**
**In each of the above cases the defendant (D) may wish to claim that although they did wrong they should not be held accountable for the harm that transpired because it is too far removed from D's initial act or omission. In which of the above cases do you agree that D should not be held accountable and in which do you think D should? Is there any pattern to your conclusions which could form the basis for general principles of application?**

**No feedback provided.**

### 4.2 Accountability: basic guidelines

A basic rule of thumb is that where a person's **voluntary act** initiates a causal sequence which ends in harm, that person will normally be held accountable unless an act or event later transpires which renders a finding of accountability inappropriate. If we examine case (a) in Activity 4.1, this produces the following analysis.

- D's act is voluntary in the sense of being under the physical and mental control of D.
- D's act is the first link in a chain of events (chain of causation) which results in V's injury.
- D is therefore accountable for that injury unless a later act or event occurs which renders a finding of accountability inappropriate.

The later act or event is V slipping over and banging her head. Does this act or event render it **inappropriate** to hold D to account for V's injury? This is the big question. We need to have a basis for saying either that D should be held accountable or that D should not. It is this basis which, in an ideal criminal justice system, will form the central principles governing accountability or causation in the criminal law. What conclusion did you reach and what was your reasoning?

Assuming you concluded that D did cause V's injury, here are some possible basic principles which you might have adopted to explain your conclusion.

- D is accountable for all the consequences of their wrongful act.
- D is accountable for all the foreseeable consequences of their wrongful act.
- D is accountable for all the foreseen consequences of their wrongful act.

Now consider the Draft Criminal Code Bill 1989, clause 17 of which is intended to be a restatement of the common law position. Clause 17 reads:

1. …a person causes a result which is an element of an offence when –

- a. he does an act which makes a more than negligible contribution to its occurrence; or
- b. he omits to do an act which might prevent its occurrence and which he is under a duty to do according to the law relating to the offence.
2. A person does not cause a result where, after he does such an act or makes such an omission, an act or event occurs –
  - a. which is the immediate and sufficient cause of the result;
  - b. which he did not foresee, and
  - c. which could not in the circumstances reasonably have been foreseen.

This is a clear and generally a pretty accurate restatement of the common law position. It renders D accountable for V's injury in case (a). D did an act (placed soap on the floor) which made a more than merely negligible contribution to the result (V's loss of consciousness) and everything that happened after putting the soap on the floor (V slipping over and banging her head) could 'in the circumstances reasonably have been foreseen'. So D is accountable for the result.

**page 39**
There are, however, certain aspects of causation doctrine which part company with this restatement. For example, the courts will sometimes treat a later voluntary act of a third party or the victim as breaking the chain of causation between act and result if it was sufficient cause of the result, even if it was perfectly foreseeable or indeed foreseen. Case (h) in Activity 4.1 is an example. In law, D is not the cause of V's death because although D began the chain and V's taking the pill was foreseen and foreseeable, V's voluntary taking of the pill breaks the chain of causation. It is now V's (voluntary) act rather than D's which causes V's death.

Now we shall look more closely at the case law and the principles of causation which derive from it.

### 4.3 Principles governing causation

As Clause 17 of the Draft Criminal Code Bill 1989 indicates, causation involves a two-part inquiry. The first part concerns how causal sequences begin, while the second part concerns how, once begun, a causal sequence may come to an end. In short, to be held accountable for a consequence involves being **both** the factual cause and also the legal cause of that consequence.

#### **4.3.1 Factual cause**

Hart and Honoré describe a factual cause as:

an event or act which 'makes the difference' between something happening and something not happening.

(*Causation and the law*. (1959))

The common way of representing this is:

- u an act is the factual cause if the consequence would not have happened **but for** that act
- u an omission is the factual cause if the consequence would not have happened **but for** the defendant's failure to act as they should have done.

Put another way, if the consequence would have happened just as it did irrespective of the defendant's act (*White* [1910] 2 KB 124) or omission (see *R* v *Morby* (1882), Chapter 3) it is not caused by the defendant. So White was not accountable for the death of his mother, whose drink he had poisoned, when she died of a heart attack before taking the poison. Nor would White be accountable had his mother swallowed the poison but died of a heart attack before the poison began to work. However, it would have been different if, in the latter case, the heart attack was prompted by the initial effects of the poison. In this latter case the **but for** principle operates because the heart attack is not **independent** of the initial act of the defendant and so forms the final link in the causal chain.

To be the factual cause of a criminal harm, D does not have to start the process leading to the consequence; it is enough that D accelerates it. So in *Dyson* [1908] 2 KB 454 a child was admitted to hospital with injuries suffered after his father had beaten him severely. At the time of his hospitalisation the child was suffering from meningitis. The child died of his injuries. Medical evidence was adduced to show that he would have died of meningitis before long. D was charged and convicted of manslaughter. He appealed on the ground that he was not a but for (factual) cause of V's death since the child would have soon died of meningitis anyway. The court said that it was not necessary to show that D was the sole cause of death so long as his action accelerated the time when death would otherwise occur.

##### **Activity 4.2**

**This question of how much acceleration needs to be established is a particular problem attached to cases of euthanasia. There have been a number of high-profile cases in which doctors have been prosecuted for murder where they have 'eased the passing' of a terminally ill patient. Examples are** *Adams* **[1957] Crim LR 365 and**  *Moor***. For interesting commentaries see Arlidge, A. 'The trial of Dr David Moor'** 

**page 40**
**(2000)** *Crim LR* **31, Smith, J.C. 'A comment on Moor's Case' (2000)** *Crim LR* **41 and Goss, J. 'A postscript to the trial of Dr David Moor' (2000)** *Crim LR* **568.** 

**Now read Wilson, Section 5.5.B.1 'The general framework for imputing cause' and explain why Dr Adams was not thought to have caused the death of his patient and what change in the facts of the case would have been necessary for the court to have reached a contrary conclusion.**

To be the factual cause of a criminal harm, the causal connection does not have to be direct. In *Mitchell* [1983] 2 All ER 427 the accused punched a man who had accused him of queue-jumping in a post office. The man fell on top of an 89-year-old woman, which initially broke her leg and consequently caused her death from a pulmonary embolism. The accused's conviction for manslaughter was upheld on appeal. He was a but for cause. In the words of the Draft Criminal Code, he did an act which made 'a more than negligible contribution' to the consequence's occurrence.

#### **4.3.2 Legal cause**

The factual cause of a consequence will also be the legal cause of that consequence, unless the factual cause is too insubstantial or remote to render it inappropriate to attribute the consequence to the act. In the words of the Draft Criminal Code a factual cause will be too remote if, subsequent to it, another act or event occurs which also contributed to the result which was not foreseen by the defendant, and could not in the circumstances reasonably have been foreseen.

The most important thing to remember here is that the judgment made by the court is not a scientific judgement, as it is with the factual cause. It is a moral judgement. The court is being asked to consider whether it is appropriate to hold the defendant to account for what has transpired. Sometimes a person can be the factual cause of a criminal harm and yet it does not seem appropriate to hold them accountable. You may well have reached this conclusion in relation to case (d) in Activity 4.1. If anybody is to be held accountable for V's death (as opposed to the rape) it is surely V's father, not D.

In this section we will consider when a factual cause of a consequence is too insignificant to be treated as the legal cause, and when it is too remote.

##### **Principles of application**

To be the legal cause of a criminal harm, the consequence must be the consequence not merely of the defendant's act but of their **wrongful** act. So if A is charged with causing B's death by dangerous driving and A does kill B by running him over in her car, while driving dangerously, this does not necessarily mean that A is guilty of causing death by dangerous driving. The crime is causing death **by** dangerous driving not causing death **while** driving dangerously. The prosecution's task in such a case is to rebuff the possibility that, although the defendant was driving dangerously, the death might still have been unavoidable because, for example, the victim jumped out in front of the car at the last second.

##### **Activity 4.3**

**Read Wilson, Section 5.5.B 'Legal cause' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. Why was the defendant in** *Dalloway* **(1847) not guilty of manslaughter, although he was driving his cart very dangerously when it ran over the child?**
- **b. A points a gun at B and threatens to kill B. C sees this. C, in trying to disarm A, causes the gun to fire and injure V, a bystander. Is C the legal cause of V's harm?**

#### **No feedback provided.**

To be a legal cause, the defendant's contribution to the result must be substantial, although it need not be the sole cause. Even if a result would not have occurred but for D's acts, it is appropriate to ask to what extent D's acts significantly contributed to the result. The criminal law ignores trivial causes. For example, in *Adams* (1957) a doctor gave his terminally ill patient a dose of painkillers so strong that it killed the patient.

**page 41**
Devlin J ruled that if the dose were given for pain relief in accordance with the doctor's duty it would not be the doctor but the disease which was the real cause of death. The doctor's contribution could be ignored as negligible.

Compare *Benge* (1865) 4 F & F 504 in which D, a foreman platelayer on a railway, failed to check the train timetable to ensure the men working for him were safe on the line. A train killed one of the workmen. D claimed that he was not the legal cause since the driver of the train could have prevented the deaths if he had kept a proper lookout. It was held that D's contribution was substantial enough to justify attributing responsibility for the death to him; his contribution was too substantial to be ignored.

#### **4.3.3 Problem cases**

The court is most likely to be taxed in deciding whether D is the legal cause of a consequence when something unusual happens following D's unlawful act. In *McKechnie* (1992) 94 Cr App R 51, for example, D beat up an elderly man, V, who suffered very serious head injuries and remained unconscious for weeks. Doctors discovered that V had a duodenal ulcer but decided that it would be too dangerous to operate because he was still unconscious from his beating. V died as a result of the ulcer bursting. D was convicted and appealed *inter alia* on the direction as to causation. The Court of Appeal, upholding his conviction, ruled that D was still the cause of V's death since the doctors' decision not to operate was due to the effects of the initial beating.

Two key points emerge from this case. The first, reflecting *Benge*, is that where more than one cause operates, as it did here, the initial wrongful act of D is still the legal cause if it is still a substantial and operative cause; in other words, if it is still strongly influential on the outcome. The second is that a later causal contribution will not prevent the initial cause being still operative **unless it is independent of the initial act**. Here the doctors' decision was not independent of the initial beating as it was influenced by that beating. If the doctors had mistakenly given the victim poison which caused the ulcer to rupture this would have been independent of the initial act, and so D would not have been the legal cause of V's death.

Sections 4.3.6–4.3.8 below present some other problem cases where the courts have to choose whether the legal cause of a criminal harm is D's wrongful act or some other act or event.

#### **4.3.4 Death precipitated by the victim's vulnerable physical or mental condition**

Occasionally the victim's death is triggered by a combination of the defendant's unlawful act and their own physical or mental vulnerability. For example, in *Hayward* (1908) 21 Cox CC 692 D chased the victim, D's wife, and threatened her with death. Unknown to him V had a weak heart and died of a heart attack. D remained accountable for the death. This principle, which is known as the 'Eggshell Skull Rule' is of general application. Simply put, D's causal responsibility for resultant harm is not deflected if V has a condition (such as a skull as fragile as an eggshell), which renders them especially likely to suffer injury or die.

##### **Activity 4.4**

**Read Wilson, Section 5.6.A 'Subsisting conditions' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. Why was Blaue the cause of V's death when V could have easily prevented it by agreeing to a blood transfusion?**
- **b. Eve asks Adam, her husband, to shoot her because she is terminally ill and wishes to die. Adam does so out of compassion and respect for her wishes. However, his shot fails to kill her but causes massive internal bleeding. Adam then realises that he does not want to be responsible for Eve's death so he takes her to hospital. The hospital tells Eve that she needs a blood transfusion and that she will die without it. Eve refuses, as she still wants to die – which she does.**

**page 42**
**Is Adam the legal cause of her death? In other words, is there any significance difference between this case and** *Blaue* **that warrants** *Blaue* **being distinguished? Please note that there is no right answer here. Questions about whether the factual cause of a criminal harm is also the cause recognised by the law is a matter of moral and common-sense judgement – so exercise yours!**

#### **4.3.5 Supervening acts of third parties**

Acts of third parties can, on occasions, break the chain of causation linking a **but for** cause to a consequence. However, these occasions are rare, as we shall now see.

##### **Acts of third parties exacerbating the harm**

If a third party contributes to the harmful result, this will not break the chain of causation if D's original act was still a substantial and operative cause of the harm. In *Smith* [1959] 2 QB 35 the victim died of a stab wound to the lung, but not before he had been dropped twice before reaching medical attention and had received artificial respiration – which is not a good idea for someone with a punctured lung! Smith was still the legal cause of V's death. Although the intervening acts contributed to the death, Smith's acts were still a substantial cause of the harm and were still operative at the time of death.

**Hint:** Consider what the autopsy report would have said to be the cause of death.

The following statement of principle given in *Smith* is a very useful summary of the general legal position governing causation.

if at the time of death the original wound is still an operating cause and a substantial cause, then the death [is] the result of the wound, albeit that some other cause is also operating. Only if it can be said that the original wounding is merely the setting in which another cause operates can it be said that the death does not result from the wound. Putting it in another way, only if the second cause is so overwhelming as to make the original wound merely part of the history can it be said that death does not flow from the wound.

##### **Activity 4.5**

**Memorise the statement of principle in** *Smith* **– it will be time well spent.**

##### **Activity 4.6**

**Read Wilson, Section 5.6.A.4(c) 'When will inappropriate medical treatment break the chain of causation?' and answer the following question.**

**If the doctors had given the victim in** *Smith* **a huge overdose of painkillers by mistake, which would have killed any patient irrespective of their condition, would this prevent the initial wound from being the 'substantial and operative cause' of V's death?**

**Acts of third parties reacting to a danger caused by A's act**

It is natural that when a person acts in a dangerous fashion third parties may act unpredictably by way of reaction. For this reason it will be rare that such a reaction will break the chain of causation linking the defendant with the eventual consequence. For an extreme example see *Pagett* (1983) 76 Cr App R 279, in which D used his pregnant girlfriend, V, as a human shield to prevent police officers arresting him. D had a shotgun with him and shot towards the police. They returned fire and V was killed. He appealed against conviction for manslaughter on the ground that the police, and not he, had caused V's death. The Court of Appeal disagreed. In reaching its decision it said:

if a reasonable act of self-defence against the act of the accused causes the death of a third party…[it does not] relieve the accused from criminal responsibility for the death of the third party.

**page 43**
##### **Activity 4.7**

**Consider the case of** *Pagett* **and answer the following questions. Remember, there are no right answers to these questions. They are simply some of the considerations the court will have in mind in deciding whether to attribute cause to the defendant when their causal contribution is not obvious.**

- **a. Do you think the police's reaction was reasonable? Do you think the real issue should be whether the police response was 'foreseeable'?**
- **b. If D had simply waved the gun in the air and the police had opened fire, with the same result, would D still be the cause of V's death?**
- **c. What principle would you adopt to support your answer to question (b) above?**

**Hint: In each case, ask yourself whether D's act was a substantial and operative cause of death; whether the police response was reasonable; whether the police response was foreseeable; whether the police response was made more likely by D's action? In principle, a 'yes' to any one of these questions might support D's conviction. Which question(s) do you think the court should ask?**

**Medical interventions**

We have already seen an example of poor medical treatment contributing to a criminal harm (*Smith*). In *Cheshire* [1991] 1 WLR 844 D shot V in the abdomen. V was taken to hospital where he was operated on. Almost immediately he started suffering breathing difficulties and so a tracheotomy was performed. Six weeks later, V's wounds were nearly healed but his breathing was getting progressively worse and he died. The doctors failed to recognise and respond to the cause of V's problems, which was that the tracheotomy had been negligently performed. The trial judge told the jury that this bad medical treatment did not relieve D from responsibility. On the basis of this direction the jury convicted. D appealed.

##### **Activity 4.8**

**Read Wilson, Section 5.6.A.3(e) 'Medical responses to the danger posed by A's conduct' and Section 5.6.A.4(c) 'When will inappropriate medical treatment break the chain of causation?' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. What was the response of the Court of Appeal to the appeal in** *Cheshire***? What principle did the Court lay down in reaching its decision? This is another principle that is worth committing to memory.**
- **b.** *Cheshire* **was quite an extreme case of bad medical treatment yet D remained liable. In what situations will bad medical treatment rid D's criminal act of 'causal potency'?**
- **c. Consider the court's decision in** *Jordan***. Is it consistent with** *Cheshire***? If not, which do you prefer and why?**

#### **4.3.6 Supervening acts of the victim**

##### **Supervening acts of the victim exacerbating the harm**

If, after they have been hurt by D, V does something which is unexpected and prejudicial to their prospects of recovery, this will not break the chain of causation if D's act is still a substantial and operative cause. For example, in *Holland* (1841) 2 Mood & R 351, V, following a serious assault with an iron bar, refused to submit to the amputation of a finger, recommended to prevent tetanus. D was held to be causally responsible for V's resultant death from tetanus. In *Blaue* [1975] 1 WLR 1411, D stabbed V, causing serious blood loss. Doctors treating V told her she needed a blood transfusion else she would die. V refused the transfusion for religious reasons and died of blood loss. D argued that he was not the cause of V's death: the cause was V's refusal. The Court of Appeal rejected this argument, stating that the defendant must 'take the victim as he finds him'. D's act was still a substantial and operative cause of death. Remember the autopsy report!

**page 44**
##### **Escape attempts**

If V is injured attempting to escape from D's unlawful attack, D will be causally responsible so long as the defensive action was attributable to that attack. In *Roberts* (1972) 56 Cr App R 95, V jumped out of a moving car in reaction to being sexually assaulted by D in the car. The Court of Appeal ruled that D was the cause of V's injuries as D's act began the causal chain and her reaction was reasonably foreseeable. The Court also stated that the chain of causation would be broken only by the victim doing something 'daft'. In *Williams and Davis* [1992] 1 WLR 380, on similar facts except that the result was the death of the escaping passenger, a slightly different test was used – namely whether V's response was within the range of responses which might be expected from a victim 'placed in the situation which he was'.

##### **Activity 4.9**

**There are three different tests of causation used in** *Roberts* **and** *Williams and Davis***. Two are used in one case!** 

- **a. One says that the chain of causation is not broken unless V does something which was not reasonably foreseeable.**
- **b. Another says the chain of causation is not broken unless V does something 'daft'.**
- **c. The final test says that the chain of causation is not broken unless V's response was 'not within the range of responses which might be expected from a victim placed in his situation'.**

**Do all these tests mean the same thing or might the tests elicit different answers? Think of some situations which might.**

**Suicide**

If V commits suicide as a result of D having raped, maimed or physically abused them, is D causally responsible for V's death? The tests of causation in Activity 4.9 are not terribly helpful here. Suicide is hardly a foreseeable response to a rape but if we ask the question 'is suicide "within the range of responses which might be expected from" a rape victim?' we would probably say yes. In *Dhaliwal* [2006] EWCA Crim 1139, a case involving suicide following a long period of domestic abuse, the Court of Appeal acknowledged that suicide could be triggered (and caused) by the most recent unlawful attack. Specifically:

** where a decision to commit suicide has been triggered by a physical assault which represents the culmination of a course of abusive conduct, it would be possible…to argue that that final assault played a significant part in causing the victim's death.**

In other words, if the suicide was simply a response to the defendant's abusive behaviour, he would not be responsible for her death. It is only where the suicide was triggered by a particular wrongful act that the jury would be entitled (not bound) to find causation proved. In 2017 another case (*R* v *Wallace* [2018] EWCA Crim 690) was decided involving a suicide triggered by the defendant's wrongful act. The defendant threw concentrated sulphuric acid over her former lover while he was sleeping. This left him blind, paralysed and suffering from catastrophic injuries and pain. Two years later he checked into a euthanasia clinic in Belgium where euthanasia is legal and his life was terminated. He had decided that he could not continue to live with his injuries and the pain to which he was still subject. The defendant was charged with murder and the trial judge refused to allow the question of causation to be considered by the jury on the ground that there was too long a delay between the act and the death. The jury convicted of throwing corrosive fluid on a person, with intent to do grievous bodily, an offence under s.29 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. The Court of Appeal ruled that the trial judge was wrong to withdraw the question of causation from the jury. It was open to the jury to conclude that, despite the separation in time between the throwing of the acid and the death, the acts of the victim were a direct response to the injuries inflicted for which the defendant was directly responsible. The question to be considered in all cases where more than one cause contributed to the death is whether 'the accused's acts can fairly be said to have made a significant contribution to the victim's death'. A retrial was ordered and in June 2018 the jury again acquitted of murder and convicted of the s.29 Offence.

##### **Activity 4.10**

**Is the principle enunciated in** *Dhaliwal* **the same as rendered** *Blaue* **liable for his victim's unforeseen decision to refuse a blood transfusion?**

### **4.4 Breaking the chain of causation**

So far you will be forgiven for thinking that nothing can prevent the attribution of legal cause to a person whose culpable act began a chain of causation which ended with the victim's death or other harm. However, in certain circumstances, the chain of causation linking act and result can be broken. It can be broken by an act or an event which, in the words of the Draft Criminal Code, was neither foreseen nor foreseeable or, in certain circumstances, by the voluntary actions of the victim or third party – whether foreseeable or not.

An act or event which breaks the chain of causation is known as a *novus actus interveniens*, or a new act intervening. Now we will examine the special characteristics of a *novus actus interveniens*, of which the case of *Jordan* (1956) is an example*.* In this case the court ruled, rightly or wrongly, that the intervening causal contribution of a third party was **so powerful and independent of the initial wrongful act** of the defendant that that act was no longer fairly treated as the cause of death.

#### **Activity 4.11**

**Read Wilson, Section 5.6.A.4(c) 'When will inappropriate medical treatment break the chain of causation?'.**

**What were the special features in** *Jordan* **which prompted the court to hold that the chain of causation had been broken? What was the test used? If that same test had been used in** *Cheshire* **would the outcome have been any different?**

When will a subsequent act or event break the chain of causation? This depends upon whether the intervening event is an act or a natural occurrence.

#### **4.4.1 New acts intervening**

**An intervening act of a third party** will break the chain of causation if it is:

- voluntary
- independent of the initial act, and
- sufficient in itself to cause the harm suffered by the victim.

For example, in the American case of *People* v *Elder* (1894), D struck V and V collapsed on the ground. Then a bystander, B, who was not part of any plan to hurt V, stepped up and kicked V, killing him. D was not guilty of homicide. Although D was a factual cause of the death, the independent and voluntary act of B broke the chain of causation. A more modern example is the English case of *Rafferty* [2007] EWCA Crim 1846, which you will find in Wilson, Section 5.6.A.4 'Breaking the chain of causation–intervening cause supersedes defendant's act'.

The requirement that the act of the third party be independent of D's act is best illustrated by the cases of *Pagett* and *Cheshire*. The acts of the police officers in *Pagett*, and the medics in *Cheshire*, did not involve new acts intervening because they were by way of reaction to D's wrongful act. They were not independent of it.

##### **Activity 4.12**

**Under what circumstances might very bad medical treatment break the chain of causation?**

**page 46**
The chain of causation in cases of intervening voluntary and independent acts is broken only if the intervening act was sufficient in itself to kill V. If V's death occurred only because V was already weakened by the initial attack the chain of causation will not be broken, as D's initial act will still be an operative and substantial cause.

As we have seen, unpredictable reactions of the victim to the defendant's wrongdoing do not generally break the chain of causation because they are not deemed to be independent of the initial act which is still an operative cause: see *Holland, Roberts* and *Blaue*, for example.

The most important cases of intervening acts of the victim breaking the chain of causation involve drug supply. In a number of cases in the past 20 years, the supplier of drugs to a person who has died following self-injection has been charged with manslaughter. The main question for the court is whether the unlawful act of supply causes the death. If we apply the usual rule of foreseeability (see *Roberts* and the Draft Criminal Code) the supply is the legal cause of death. However, supplying drugs to someone does not **cause them** to take the drugs. It is their choice. In other words, the cause of death seems to be the voluntary act of the victim in self-injecting rather than that of the supplier in supplying it to them.

For a number of years the courts could not decide which test to apply. In *Finlay* [2003] EWCA Crim 3868 the Court of Appeal said that the supplier had caused the death because it was foreseeable that the recipient would self-inject. The position now, following *Kennedy (No 2)* [2007] UKHL 38, is that the test is not whether the victim's act was foreseeable but whether it was voluntary. A free and informed choice to self-inject the drug breaks the chain of causation. It would not be free and informed if the victim lacked mental capacity or did not know of the strength of the drug.

We need to make one qualification to this. If the supplier witnesses the victim losing consciousness and fails to do anything to remedy the situation, a different causal inquiry may result in the supplier's conviction for manslaughter. In such a case, the supplier's omission in breach of duty (see *Evans* in Chapter 3 of this module guide) will be the new intervening cause of death.

#### **4.4.2 Intervening events**

An intervening event will break the chain of causation if it is:

- u abnormal
- u independent of D's act (i.e. a complete coincidence), and
- u sufficient in itself to cause the death or other harm.

This would apply to case (e) in Activity 4.1, the ambulance case. It would also apply if V died in hospital due to an earthquake or contracted a fatal illness independent of their condition. For example, in *Bush* v *Commonwealth* (1880) V died of scarlet fever contracted in hospital following D's attack. D was held not to be the cause of death.

However, an intervening event will not break the chain of causation if the risk of it happening was created by or increased by D's act. For example, if D leaves V unconscious by the side of the road and V later stumbles on to the road and into the path of a passing car (*Corbett* [1996] Crim LR 594), if D leaves V on the beach and the tide comes in and drowns V, or if D leaves V in a cemetery and a wild animal attacks V (*The Harlot's Case* (1560)), D will remain causally accountable for the resulting harm, death or serious injury, as the case may be.

##### **Activity 4.13**

**Read Wilson, Section 5.6.A.4 'Breaking the chain of causation – intervening cause supersedes defendant's act' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. Is there one test of causation or are there a number of different tests depending upon the facts of the case?**
- **b. Do you think** *Kennedy (No 2)* **is rightly decided?**

**page 47**
**c. Consider the** *Environment Agency* **v** *Empress Cars* **case. Is it consistent with**  *Kennedy***? Do you agree with the decision?**
- **d. Compare** *Rafferty* **with** *Maybin***. Which decision do you prefer, and why?**
- **e. Was the deceased's suicide in** *Wallace***, above, a voluntary decision in the sense intended in** *Kennedy***?**
