## Topic reading
Core text
• Wilson and Lammasniemi, Chapter 16 'Other property offences'.

## Introduction

The offences we have examined so far have, as their wrongdoing component, some form of interference with, or harm caused to, a person's physical or mental wellbeing, including, at the extreme, homicide. The next two chapters involve property offences, whose wrongdoing component consists of some of form of interference with, or damage to, a person's property, interests in property, or financial security. The offences include theft, burglary, robbery, fraud and criminal damage and are largely codified in statute, most notably, the Theft Act 1968, The Criminal Damage Act 1971 and the Fraud Act 2006.

## **12.1 Theft**

The law relating to property offences was codified in 1968 in the form of the Theft Act, which aimed to simplify, consolidate and reform the previous ragbag of property offences. It was only partially successful. Although the law of theft, burglary, robbery and handling remains largely as enacted, the law relating to fraud was found not fit for purpose and was replaced first in the Theft Act 1978, and then again in the Fraud Act 2006.

Theft, and the elements thereof, are defined in ss.1–6 of the Theft Act 1968, although, as will be seen, the Act does not purport to give a comprehensive definition of the various conduct and mental elements. Theft is defined in s.1, which states that:

A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it.

Following the usual criminal template, therefore, the actus reus of theft is the appropriation of property belonging to another; and the mens rea is dishonesty as to the appropriation together with an intention permanently to deprive the owner of the property. Each of these elements will be examined in turn, beginning with the *actus reus*, which comprises three elements – all of which the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt.

- There must be property.
- The property must be appropriated by the defendant.
- The property appropriated must belong to another at the time of the appropriation of it.

### 12.1.1 Actus reus: theft

#### **Property**

There is a comprehensive definition of property in s.4 of the Theft Act 1968. Subsection 4(1) gives us a general statement to the effect that property:

includes money and all other property, real or personal, including things in action and other intangible property.

Subsection 4(2) then qualifies subsection (1) by severely restricting the scope of stealable land (real property). The reason for this is simple. It is not generally possible to appropriate a parcel of land since land cannot disappear as watches and handbags can. If your neighbour appropriates one metre of your garden for their garden, your remedy is in civil trespass, not criminal theft.

Real property means land and interests in land, such as a tenancy. Personal property means material objects which can (as a rule) be bought and sold: for example, furniture, clocks, pictures, food, books, clothes and so on. Things in action are not material objects but are things of value which can be liquidated into money and enforced in the courts. A debt is a good example.

Subsection 4(2)(a) states the general rule that land and interests in land cannot be stolen and its exceptions:

(2) A person cannot steal land, or things forming part of land and severed from it by him or by his directions, except in the following cases, that it to say  $-$ 

(a) when he is a trustee or personal representative, or is authorised by power of attorney, or as liquidator of a company, or otherwise, to sell or dispose of land belonging to another, and he appropriates the land or anything forming part of it by dealing with it in breach of the confidence reposed in him...

This exception is intended to cover cases such as that of an executor of a will who, instead of transferring the land to the intended beneficiary, sells it for their own purposes.

Subsections 4(2)(b)and (c) make a further qualification to deal with the case of people who steal things from off the land which formed part of the land at the time of the appropriation. So, a person can steal land if:

(b) when he is not in possession of the land [he] appropriates anything forming part of the land by severing it or causing it to be severed, or after it has been severed; or

(c) when, being in possession of the land under a tenancy, he appropriates the whole or part of any fixture or structure let to be used with the land.

Subsection 4(2)(b) deals with the case of trespassers who, for example, steal turf or topsoil, garden trees or shrubs, garden fixtures such as fountains or stone terraces, or parts of the house such as lead from the roof or a fireplace or staircase.

Subsection 4(2)(c) deals with the case of tenants, who cannot steal turf or topsoil, garden trees or shrubs, but can steal fixtures such as fountains and stone terraces.

Subsections 4(3) and (4) deal with another exception. Again, the property concerned is not land itself but is a thing forming part of the land:

(3) A person who picks mushrooms growing wild on any land, or who picks flowers, fruit or foliage from a plant fincluding shrubs or trees] growing wild on any land, does not (although not in possession of the land) steal what he picks, unless he does it for reward or for sale or other commercial purpose.

(4) Wild creatures, tamed or untamed, shall be regarded as property; but a person cannot steal a wild creature not tamed nor ordinarily kept in captivity, or the carcase of any such creature, unless either it has been reduced into possession by or on behalf of another person and possession of it has not since been lost or abandoned...

A person who picks flowers from a flowerbed or greenhouse, or apples from a garden tree commits the actus reus of theft, since apples and flowers are property. Subsection 4(3) applies to their 'wild' counterparts. It affirms that wildflowers, or fruit or foliage from wild trees or plants on other people's land, do not count as property capable of being stolen unless it is done for some kind of commercial purpose.

**YES** 

Identifying the property

A key task in deciding whether theft of property has occurred is identifying the property. Misidentifying the property means the charge will fail, even though a theft has been committed.

#### **Bodies and body parts**

One cannot steal bodies or body parts because bodies are not personal property. In Sharpe (1857) 169 ER 959, D dug up a corpse and sold it to a surgeon for dissection. D was charged with and convicted of theft, but his conviction was quashed. As was said in this case, 'a body wants no owner'. The same rule applies to body parts.

#### **Illustration 1**

A cuts a lock of B's hair because B is a pop star and she wants a keepsake.

A has not committed theft of the hair. This is an offence against the person (battery), not against property. A similar conclusion follows if the hair is on the floor of the hairdresser's, except here there is no criminal offence at all. There are some qualifications to this to cover cases such as mummies and corpses for dissection, which take on the properties of property rather than being simply a corpse. Authority for this is Kelly [1999] QB 621, in which a Royal College of Surgeons' technician gave body parts to D, who was an artist. These included human heads, arms, legs and torsos. D made casts of the body parts, which were exhibited in an art gallery. Both D and the technician were convicted of theft, but in their appeal they contended the body parts did not constitute property. The appeal was dismissed. A corpse, or part of a corpse, is capable of being property within s.4 of the Theft Act 1968 if it has acquired different attributes by virtue of the application of skill, such as dissection or preservation techniques, for exhibition or teaching purposes.

Using the same reasoning, in Welsh [1974] RTR 478, a driver was guilty of theft for removing his own urine specimen from a police station. He did this to avoid a conviction for driving with excess alcohol.

#### **Study task 2**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 14.2.A.2(b) 'Things in action and other intangible property' and Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 14.2.A.2 'Property: general definition', Section (a) 'Human body parts' and state what, if anything, has been stolen in the following questions.

- a. A draws forged cheques owned by B for the sum of £1,000 on B's bank account and pays them into his account, causing a transfer of funds (a variation of what happened in Chan Man-Sin v A-G for Hong Kong  $[1988]$  1 WLR 196).
- b. A takes B's cheque for £100 given to B by C as payment for a bicycle. A pays the cheque into her bank account, causing a transfer of funds from C's account to A's account. What has A stolen?
- c. A eats a meal in a restaurant, although he has no money, and leaves without paying the bill, which is £20.
- d. A, a hairdresser, collects his client's hair with which to make cushions. He keeps the hair in a refuse bag pending stuffing the cushions. B, a rival cushion stuffer, takes the hair, having put it in her own bag. What, if anything, has B stolen?

Show feedback

a. A has stolen some cheque forms. He has also stolen a thing in action (part of the banks indebtedness to B).

- b. A has not stolen £100. She has stolen a piece of paper (the cheque form) and a thing in action  $-$  the reduction in the balance owing to C by C's bank, caused by A's action.
- c. Assuming A knew what he was doing at the time of eating the meal he has stolen the food. He does not steal £20. If he discovered his lack of money only after the event, he has stolen nothing.
- d. Nothing.

#### Appropriation

Prior to the Theft Act 1968, the essence of theft, or larceny as it was known, was the taking and carrying away of personal property. (One of the key differences between larceny and theft introduced by the Theft Act is that there is no longer any need for a taking and carrying away of the property. It is not needed but is sufficient.) Appropriation is defined by s.3(1) of the Theft Act 1968, which states:

Any assumption by a person of the rights of an owner amounts to an appropriation, and this includes, where he has come by the property (innocently or not) without stealing it, any later assumption of a right to it by keeping or dealing with it as owner.

This statement emphasises that it is not necessary to physically take property to appropriate it. Indeed, as the provision makes clear, one can even appropriate property which is lawfully in one's possession. A person who finds property, or borrows it, is not committing theft. However, if they subsequently assume rights of ownership over the property – for example, by selling it, lending it to someone else, or deciding to keep it – this amounts to an appropriation of the property. In deciding whether the defendant has appropriated the relevant property, the first question to be asked therefore is what the rights of an owner comprise. The second question is whether the defendant has assumed one of those rights and, if so, which one. If the defendant exercises any of these rights over property belonging to someone else, they appropriate that property.

In Pitham and Hehl(1977) 65 Cr App R 45, the defendant invited two people into his friend's house while his friend was in prison and offered to sell them his friend's furniture. The Court of Appeal held that this offer constituted an appropriation, as it was an assumption of one of the rights of ownership, namely the right to sell. Compare the recent case of R v Darroux [2018] EWCA Crim 1009. The defendant filled out claim forms for overtime and expenses, which she gave to her employers. The claims were grossly inflated. She was charged with theft of the moneys transferred to her account via bank transfer. In order to gain a conviction, the prosecution had to show that the money coming into her account came there as a result of her assuming a right of ownership over it. Had she?

What had she done? What she had done was to fill out some claim forms, which was a long way from doing anything in regard to the money. Yes, she had caused the transfer but, no, she did not cause it by way of appropriation. She did it by way of writing a false claim form. The Court of Appeal quashed her conviction.

#### **Study task 3**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 14.2.A 'Actus reus'. List as many rights of ownership as you can think of and consider how each of these rights could be appropriated. Then consider the following questions.

- a. What rights of ownership did the defendant in Morris (1983) appropriate? How did he do so?
- b. If A takes the key of a car so that he can steal the car later, has he appropriated only the key or also the car?
- c. Would Mrs Darroux have appropriated the money transferred into her account if she had drawn a cheque on it?

Show feedback

- a. The right to price the goods. He did so by changing the price labels.
- b. Possessing the key to a car is one of the rights of the owner, so yes, it seems he has stolen the car. It seems a bit strange though doesn't it?
- c. Yes

#### Consent and appropriation

Is it a necessary ingredient in an appropriation that the act be unauthorised? In Lawrence [1972] AC 626, the House of Lords said no. An Italian student took a lift in a taxi. At the end of the trip, as he did not speak good English, he held out his wallet for the taxi driver to take the right fare. The taxi driver took far more than the correct fare and was charged and convicted of theft of the money. He appealed on the basis that the trial judge should have told the jury that there could be no appropriation if the owner consented. The House of Lords upheld the conviction, stating that the statutory definition of appropriation did not include the words 'without the owner's consent'.

So, even if the student had truly consented to the taking of the money, it had still been appropriated by the taxi driver.

The House of Lords came to a different conclusion in Morris [1984] AC 320. The defendant had swapped price tags on a tin of beans in a supermarket in order to purchase the beans at a lower price. He was arrested by a store detective before reaching the checkout and charged with theft of the can. Upholding the conviction, the House of Lords concluded that it was of the essence of an appropriation that the act be by way of 'adverse interference or usurpation of the owner's rights'. Contrary to Lawrence (where taking the money from the wallet was an appropriation despite the owner's authority), their Lordships concluded that taking the goods off the shelf was not an appropriation because self-service shops authorise this act. It was only when the price labels were swapped that an appropriation occurred, because this was not authorised and was adverse to the owner's right. Similar decisions were reached in Meech [1974] QB 549 and a number of other cases, including Fritschy [1985] Crim LR 745.

The conflict between the approaches taken in Lawrence and Morris was finally resolved in Gomez [1993] AC 442. D, the assistant manager of a shop, agreed with his accomplice, R (a customer), to help him acquire goods in exchange for two stolen cheques. Knowing that the cheques were stolen, D deceived the shop manager into authorising the sale of the goods to the customer in exchange for the cheques. D was charged with theft contrary to s.1(1) of the Theft Act 1968 and was convicted at first instance. He appealed, submitting that the goods had been sold under a contract between the customer and the shop, and that there could be no appropriation of property belonging to another where the act relied upon was a contract of sale passing ownership to the customer. The Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) agreed and allowed D's appeal against conviction. On appeal by the Crown, the House of Lords held that the fact that the act had been authorised/consented to in no way prevented it from being an appropriation. It was not of the essence of an appropriation that it constituted some form of challenge to, or overriding of, the owner's rights.

In Gomez, the transfer was defective because the shop manager's consent was obtained by fraud and so the transfer of ownership could be undone. Does the person who induces the transfer also appropriate property where there has been no fraud and where the transferee receives an absolute title to the property?

This was the question the House of Lords had to answer in Hinks [2001] 2 AC 241. In this case, D had befriended V, a naïve and gullible man, and encouraged him to make her gifts of money from his bank account. She was convicted of theft, although there was no evidence of duress or deception, or that V had parted with the money otherwise than by gift. The defence case was that the recipient of a valid gift could not be guilty of theft. Either there is a valid transfer of title or there is an appropriation. There cannot be both. Lord Steyn said that, whether or not V had gifted the money, D, by acquiring title, had appropriated it. The acquisition of title, on this view, is simply the clearest possible case of 'assuming rights of ownership'. This was a surprising decision, because the

transfer is considered valid by the civil law  $-$  V could not claim the money back in the civil courts, as it was a perfect gift – but it was an invalid transfer according to the criminal law. D was guilty of stealing the money, assuming her obtaining of the money was thought to be dishonest. The same principle applies to all other transactions involving the transfer of ownership, such as contracts for sale (Gomez).

#### **Study task 4**

The House of Lords made it clear in *Hinks* that, despite their find that an appropriation had occurred, most people who received property by way of gift would not be guilty of theft. Liability in such a case will depend upon whether D was dishonest in receiving the gift. Most receivers of gifts are not - thank goodness! Now read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 14.2.B.2 'Dishonesty' and decide whether Mrs Hinks was dishonest as in receiving her gift and how the court approached the question of dishonesty. Once you have done that you might wish to read the dissenting opinion of Lord Hobhouse who, however immoral you think Mrs Hinks was, is surely right in concluding that she was not. You will find Hinks in the Online Library  $\mathbb{Z}$ .

 Show feedback

If a person appropriates property belonging to another believing that the other would consent if they knew the full circumstances they cannot be dishonest  $(s.2(1)(b))$ . If this is the case Mrs Hinks is not dishonest because it is clear she thought Mr Dolphin was fully consenting to her having the money. Only if we apply Ghosh is she dishonest. But we cannot apply Ghosh if s.2(1)(b) applies. It takes priority. Lord Hobhouse is right. The majority are wrong (in my opinion).

#### Belonging to another

A person cannot be guilty of theft if the property they appropriate does not belong to another person. But a person can be quilty of theft if they appropriate property that belongs to them! How can this be? The answer to this question is to be found in s.5 of the Theft Act 1968, which defines the term 'belonging to another'. Section 5(1) states that property belongs to 'any person having possession or control of it or having in it any proprietary right or interest'.

The consequence of this rather puzzling subsection is that a person can commit theft of their own property, so long as it also belongs to someone else for the purpose of s.5. To understand this section properly, let us assume that the property is a racehorse, which is owned by a Mr Southwell. For the purpose of the Theft Act 1968, the racehorse belongs to:

- Mr Southwell
- Mrs Goodwood, a part owner
- Ms Lingfield, the owner of the stables where the racehorse is stabled
- Mr Aintree, the jockey, when he takes the horse for a gallop (during the gallop)
- Mr Doncaster, the blacksmith, to whom the horse is delivered for a few hours to be shod (during those hours)
- Mrs Wincanton, the owner's friend, to whom he lends the horse to compete in a race (during the loan period)
- The Happy Valley Finance Company, which lends Mr Southwell £50,000, using the horse as security.

If any of these people appropriate the racehorse from any one of the others, they have appropriated 'property belonging to another'. The racehorse belongs to Mr Southwell, Mrs Goodwood and the Happy Valley Finance Company, since each has 'proprietary rights or interests in the horse'. It belongs to the other parties by virtue of their possession or control during the time they are in possession or have control. This does not, of course, mean that they are necessarily guilty of theft, because of the need to establish all the elements of the offence – in particular, dishonesty. If Mr Southwell took back the horse from Mrs Wincanton without formally terminating the bailment he would have appropriated property belonging to another, but he would not usually be quilty of theft, since his taking would not be dishonest and, moreover, Mrs Wincanton would have no right as against him to retain the horse, and so he could terminate the bailment perfectly legitimately simply by taking the horse. In Meredith [1973] Crim LR 253, the defendant took his own car from a police car park where it had been impounded. He was indicted for theft. The trial judge directed the jury to acquit on the ground that the police, although having possession and control of the car for the purpose of s.5(1), had no right to retain the car as against him.

#### Abandoned property

If property is abandoned, it may belong to no one, in which case it cannot be stolen. However, even abandoned property may belong to someone else – for example, the owner of the land or vessel in which the property is found.

In Hibbert v McKiernan [1948] 2 KB 142, D was a trespasser on land owned by a golf club who collected golf balls lost and abandoned by their owners. He was charged with theft. D argued that, having been abandoned, the balls belonged to no one; the King's Bench Divisional Court disagreed. Although the balls no longer belonged to their previous owners, they did belong to the club. Since D was a trespasser, the golf club had the right to exclude him from the course and, therefore, from the balls. To that extent, the club had control of the balls and so they belonged to the club for the purpose of s.5. Note that this means that other golfers would not be committing theft of balls which they found on the course. These balls, having been abandoned, would belong to no one as against

them. It is for this reason also that I am not guilty of theft when, every Saturday, I collect a dozen or so golf balls from my garden which some unfortunate golfer has hit there from the golf course abutting my property. The golf balls belong to me. I do not own them but, for the purposes of s.5, I am the only person who cannot steal them.

Williams v Phillips (1957) 41 Cr App R 5 is a comparable case to that of Hibbert v McKiernan. A householder put refuse out for collection by the local authority refuse workers. It was held by the Divisional Court that such refuse remained property belonging to the householder until collected, whereupon property passed to the local authority. So, refuse workers helping themselves to such property could be convicted of theft, on the basis that the property had always belonged to someone (see also Woodman [1974] QB 754 and Hancock [1990] Crim LR 125).

#### **Study task 5**

See Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 14.2.A.3(b) 'Theft by owners'. If A, a householder, hires a building skip into which to throw her doors and windows, which she is replacing, does B appropriate 'property belonging to another' if he takes them? In order to answer this question you must consider whether there is any difference between this case and that of Williams v Phillips.

Show feedback

This is arguable. There is a greater case for arguing that this property belongs to no one because in a skip, like on a rubbish dump, nobody is in control of the property.

#### The property must belong to another at the time of appropriation

In Chodorek v Poland [2017] ACD 244 (82) QBD, the Administrative Court confirmed that a person who uses a debit card at an ATM to withdraw cash commits theft if he has no overdraft facility and knows he does not have the funds to cover the amount withdrawn. All the elements of the offence are present, namely a dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. The property appropriated in this case is money (i.e. personal property), not a thing in action. And, at the time of the appropriation, the money belonged to the issuing bank and not to him, as he was not in credit.

Corcoran v Whent [1977] Crim LR 52 is a perfect, if rare, example of how a theft conviction was not possible because the property appropriated no longer belonged to another person at the time of appropriation. D ate food in a restaurant with a friend. When he left the restaurant, his friend told him that the meal had not been paid for. D did not go back to pay for the meal, although his intentions on entering the restaurant were perfectly honest. He was later arrested, charged and convicted of theft. D's conviction was quashed on the ground that, although all the

elements of theft were present, they did not coincide. At the time the appropriation (eating) of the property (food) belonging to another (restaurant) occurred he had no mens rea for theft. At the time the mens rea was formed he did not appropriate property belonging to another for three simple reasons: (i) one cannot assume rights of ownership over the contents of one's stomach, (ii) the food was no longer food (property), it was mush in his stomach and (iii) it belonged to no one, not even him!

Subsection 5(3) of the Theft Act 1968

This is a deceptively difficult subsection designed to cover the case of someone who has passed ownership and possession in property to someone else for a particular purpose and that purpose is disregarded. Is the transferee guilty of theft? The subsection reads:

Where a person receives property from or on account of another and is under an obligation to the other to retain and deal with that property or its proceeds in a particular way, the property or proceeds shall be regarded (as against him) as belonging to the other.

This subsection has the effect that if A gives property (e.g. money) to B to do something specific with it (e.g. pay a bill, deliver to charity), B commits theft if they do something else with it even if B has become the sole legal owner of the property.

The major problem arises in deciding whether an obligation has arisen to deal with the transferred property in a particular way. By 'obligation' is meant legal obligation. Easy cases involve money which is explicitly earmarked by the transferor for a particular purpose.

#### **Illustration 2**

 Chen is collecting for the charity Prisoner's Aid outside a train station. Nico puts £5 into Chen's collection box. Chen later takes out the £5 and buys a spicy chicken burger with it.

As far as the civil law and  $s.5(1)$  are concerned, the £5 belongs only to Chen. It no longer belongs to Nico, nor does it yet belong to the charity. Section 5(3), however, deems the money still to belong to the donor, although technically they have transferred possession and all rights and ownership over the money to the donee. This is because charity collectors owe an obligation to the donors to hand over their donations to the relevant charity. Therefore, Chen is guilty of theft. This is exactly what happened and was decided in Wain [1995] 2 Cr App R 660.

In Davidge v Bunnett [1984] Crim LR 297, the defendant shared a flat with others, who gave her cheques to pay their joint gas bill. It was understood that D would have to pay the cheques into her own bank account before doing so by drawing a cheque in favour of the gas company. In fact she spent the proceeds on Christmas presents. The Divisional Court held that s.5(3) applied, and that D was under a legal obligation to use the proceeds to pay the bill, and therefore they were property belonging to another (the flatmates) by virtue of s.5(3).

Compare this case with DPP v Huskinson (1988) 152 JP 582, where it was held not to be theft to use housing benefit for purposes other than paying the recipient's rent. The point of the relevant legislation was to impose a duty upon the social services to pay benefit to the recipient. It was not the point of the legislation to impose an obligation on the recipient to apply it directly for that purpose. In short, the housing benefit was his own to deal with as he saw fit.

#### **Study task 6**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 14.2.A.3 "Belonging to another": who does property belong to?', Section (c) 'Special cases of belonging' and answer the following questions.

- a. Why was the travel agent in Hall (1972) not guilty of theft?
- b. Who decides whether D has an obligation to deal with the property in a particular way and what is taken into account in deciding this?

 Show feedback

- a. He was not, in the words of section 5(3) under a legal obligation to deal with customer's deposits in a particular way. In other words it was open to him to put the deposits in his general trading account which was the reason why, on becoming insolvent, the customers could not recover them.
- b. The jury is told to take into account the nature and terms of the agreement by which the money/property was to be transferred.

Subsection 5(4) of the Theft Act 1968

Subsection 5(4) was designed to address problems such as occurred in Moynes v Cooper [1956] 1 QB 439, in which an employer paid an employee's salary twice into the employee's bank account by mistake and the employee spent it. Under the civil law, the funds in the account (thing in action) belong to the account holder.

Subsection 5(4) confirms that the property mistakenly transferred or otherwise received belongs also to the transferor for the purpose of the law of theft, so that if the transferee treats the property as their own they will be guilty of theft. It states:

Where a person gets property by another's mistake and is under an obligation to make restoration (in whole or in part) of the property or its proceeds or of the value thereof, then to the extent of that obligation the property or proceeds shall be regarded (as against him) as belonging to the person entitled to restoration, and an intention not to make restoration shall be regarded accordingly as an intention to deprive that person of the property or proceeds.

It has been made clear in a number of cases that reliance on s.5(4) is not strictly necessary to denote the relevant property as belonging to another. In Shadrokh-Cigari [1988] Crim LR 465, a bank account was wrongly credited with approximately £286,000 rather than the £286 owing. D took and spent the money. He was convicted of theft of the money on the basis that it remained property belonging to another, namely the issuing bank.

### 12.1.2 Mens rea: theft

#### Dishonesty

The dishonesty requirement reflects the general principle that criminalisation is inappropriate if the defendant has not acted in a socially unacceptable or immoral fashion (see Section 1.2 of this module guide). Whether or not an appropriation of a person's property is socially acceptable or not depends to a certain extent on why it was done. If the property was a gun, for example, and it was done to prevent the owner killing with it, it might be considered morally incoherent to convict the appropriator of theft. This would mean that the defendant would be expected to prioritise a property interest above a personal interest. Why would they? Why should they?

Dishonesty is not defined in the Theft Act 1968. However, s.2 of the Act tells us what dishonesty is not. Section 2(1) states that certain beliefs of the defendant are inconsistent with having a dishonest state of mind. These are:

- a. a belief that he has in law the right to deprive the other of it, on behalf of himself or of a third person; or
- b. a belief that he would have the other's consent if the other knew of the appropriation and the circumstances of it: or
- c. a belief that the person to whom the property belongs cannot be discovered by taking reasonable steps.

The gun example above is a possible illustration of where  $s.2(1)(a)$  might apply. So also is the case where D takes a sum of money from V believing they have the right to it because V owes them that same sum (compare Robinson (1977) Crim LR 173). So also is Hinks, although the court at first instance obviously thought otherwise. An example of s.2(1)(b) is where D takes V's milk from the refrigerator of their jointly occupied flat for a cup of tea,

having used all their own milk. An example of s.2(1)(c) is where D finds a sum of money in a public area which, because of its relatively small size, they conclude will never be reported to the police. The key point here is not that D does have this right  $(s.2(1)(a))$  or does have V's consent  $(s.2(1)(b))$ , or that the property cannot be returned to the owner by taking reasonable steps  $(s.2(1)(c))$ , but that D has this belief. The jury will decide this by reference to all the evidence.

It was once thought that if D did not have one of the beliefs in s.2 then they were automatically dishonest as a matter of law. This view was rejected in a number of cases in the early years following the passing of the Act. The reason for this was explained by Lawton LJ in Feely [1973] 1 QB 530. He said that immorality was of the essence of stealing and the mere fact that a person takes property when he knows he has no right or the owner would not consent does not render the taking immoral, as the above gun example makes clear.

The facts of Feely help us understand this point. D was a cashier in a betting office who, contrary to his firm's instructions, took some money out of the till on a Friday, intending to repay it on the Monday. He left a note to this effect in the till. D was charged with theft. The trial judge held that D's actions were clearly dishonest. Section 2 did not apply and his intention to replace the money was irrelevant. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal. Lawton LJ agreed that a person could be acting honestly although s.2 did not apply. He said that the final decision on whether the appropriation is dishonest lies not with the judge but was a question of fact which should have been left to the jury. He said:

Jurors, when deciding whether an appropriation was dishonest can be reasonably expected to, and should, apply the current standards of ordinary decent people. In their own lives they have to decide what is and what is not dishonest. We can see no reason why, when in a jury box, they should require the help of a judge to tell them what amounts to dishonesty.

A different direction for dishonesty – which is slightly more beneficial to the defence – was laid down in Ghosh [1982] QB 1053, a case on fraud (which carries the same dishonesty requirement). The defendant was a consultant at a hospital. He falsely claimed fees in respect of an operation that he had not carried out. D claimed that he thought he was not dishonest, since he was owed the same amount of money for consultation fees. The judge directed the jury members, in accordance with Feely, that they must simply apply their own standards as ordinary decent people. D was convicted and his appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. Lord Lane CJ stated that the jury must consider if the conduct of the accused was dishonest according to the 'ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people' (if not, then the prosecution fails). If it is dishonest according to those standards, then the jury must then go on to consider whether the accused 'must have realised that what he was doing was by those standards dishonest'.

The significant aspect of this direction is that it permits an acquittal in cases where the defendant is dishonest according to prevailing social standards but does not realise this. Critics describe the test as a Robin Hood defence.

#### Ivey v Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67

The Ghosh test was abandoned by the Supreme Court in a case decided under the Gambling Act 2005. The question for the Court was whether Mr Ivey, a professional gambler, was acting dishonestly – that he was cheating - in gambling with cards, which, although provided by the casino, he was able to identify by virtue of a defective pattern on the cards' reverse side. He argued that he was not dishonest because, whatever the general public might feel about the honesty of his actions, as a professional gambler he considered what he did to be simply good gambling and assumed the public would think likewise. The Supreme Court rejected this argument. In so doing, it found that the second limb was defective, in that it introduced an unnecessary and problematic subjective element into the assessment of dishonesty. Whether someone is dishonest or not does not vary with the defendant's own assessment of what counts as dishonesty, but is decided according to objective standards of ordinary, reasonable people. In future, only the first question is to be considered: that is, whether, according to the standards of reasonable and honest people, what was done was dishonest. This returns the law to the position in Feely [1973] 1 All ER 341 and will become the standard test for dishonesty in theft, fraud and other offences in which dishonesty is an element.

The procedure in relation to directing the jury on dishonesty is first of all to ask it to consider whether s.2 is applicable. If it is, that is an end to the matter and D is acquitted. If it is not, the jury must then consider whether the defendant is dishonest according to the *Ivey/Feely* test: that is, according to the standards of ordinary people as represented by the jury.

A five-strong Court of Appeal in R v Barton and Booth [2020] EWCA Crim 575 has confirmed that the obiter comments as to the test for dishonesty – set out in the judgment of Lord Hughes in Ivey v Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67 – constitute the law to be applied when an issue arises as to alleged dishonesty. First, what was the defendant's actual state of knowledge or belief as to the facts and, secondly, was his conduct dishonest by the standards of ordinary decent people? The subjective question of whether a defendant appreciated that his behaviour was dishonest by those standards no longer applies.

#### Intention permanently to deprive

A defendant commits theft only if it is their intention for the victim never to recover the property. So, if D intends only to borrow property or use it for a temporary period, this cannot be theft, however dishonest the taking is. The key point here is that this is a mens rea rather than an actus reus element. Theft does not require the victim to be permanently deprived of their property. It simply requires D to have this intention at the precise moment they appropriate the property. Intention includes conditional intention; that is, the intention of someone who appropriates property – say a handbag – conditionally on the contents proving sufficiently valuable to take permanently. To gain a conviction, however, it is necessary for the prosecution to draft the charge so as not to refer to any specific property (compare Easom [1971] 2 QB 315), for example by charging D with theft of 'articles unknown, the contents of a handbag belonging to X' (see also A-G's Reference (Nos 1 and 2 of 1979) [1979] 3 All ER 143).

In the case of fungibles, such as money, food, drink and so on, this intention exists even if D intends to return an identical sum, amount of food, drink and so on. This was made clear in Velumy/ [1989] Crim LR 299, in which D had taken money from his employer's safe and claimed that he intended to pay it back after the weekend. The Court of Appeal held that D had not intended to return the exact coins and notes, and that therefore he was properly convicted of theft on proof of dishonesty. (Note: in such cases, it would be far better for D to contend that he was not dishonest, given his intention to replace the money with an equivalent fund.)

Subsections 6(1) and 6(2) of the Theft Act 1968 provide two special circumstances beyond its normal meaning where the intention to take something temporarily counts as an intention permanently to deprive the owner of the property.

#### Subsection 6(1) of the Theft Act 1968

A person is to be treated as having an intention to permanently deprive the owner of his property if his intention is to:

treat the thing as his own to dispose of regardless of the other's rights; and a borrowing or lending of it may amount to so treating it if, but only if, the borrowing or lending is for a period and in circumstances making it equivalent to an outright taking or disposal.

This provision refers to cases where the appropriation amounts to an outright taking or disposal but the defendant nevertheless shows no particular commitment to depriving V of the property permanently (Coffey [1987] Crim LR 498). An obvious example is where D appropriates V's property, for example his dog or his painting, intending to ransom the property back to V upon payment of a sum of money. Another example is where D intends to exhaust the value of the property before returning it. So, if D 'borrows' V's ticket for the Manchester United game against Manchester City, intending to return it after the game, D has  $-$  by virtue of  $s.6(1)$  – the intention to permanently deprive V of her property, because D is treating the ticket as his own to dispose of regardless of the other's rights.

In Marshall, Coombes and Eren [1998] 2 Cr App R 282, the Court of Appeal ruled that selling on a used but unexpired tube ticket counts, by virtue of s.6(1), as involving an intention permanently to deprive London Underground of the ticket – even though the ticket will eventually find its way back to London Underground – since the seller is treating the thing as their own to dispose of (through sale), regardless of the other's rights. In DPP v Lavender [1994] Crim LR 297, the defendant removed some doors from a council property that was due for demolition and then installed the doors in his girlfriend's flat, which was also owned by the council. D was charged with theft of the doors. It was held that he did have the intention to permanently deprive under s.6(1) as, by installing the doors at another's house, D was treating the doors as if they were his own to dispose of regardless of the owner's rights.

This provision has generally been interpreted rather restrictively. It does not cover, for example, the case of a person who 'borrows', without the owner's consent, a very valuable piece of jewellery, intending to return it at the end of their year-long holiday. The courts have insisted that the defendant's intention must be to exhaust the property's usefulness or sell or otherwise get rid of it – for example, by leaving it in a remote or private location (Lavender). In Lloyd [1985] QB 829, D worked as a projectionist at a cinema and allowed B to take the films to make pirate copies and then return them. The Court of Appeal quashed D and B's convictions on the ground that they lacked the intention permanently to deprive the owner of the films, not having sought to dispose of the films, and that s.6(1) did not cover the case of borrowing for a dishonest purpose, however damaging to the owner's rights this may be.

#### Subsection 6(2) of the Theft Act 1968

By subs.6(2), A is deemed to have the intention to permanently deprive B of B's property if A parts with property in A's possession or control under a condition which A may not be able to perform. This is intended to cover the kind of case where someone who has property belonging to someone else in their possession or control pawns that property to another.

## Mini lecture 1 - PROPERTY OFFENCES 1: THEFT

Prof William Wilson, Criminal law


Property Offenses 1: theft. An introduction to analyzing theft problems using the Statute. All of the offenses we have covered so far are offenses against the person. These are offenses in which the defendant somehow harms the victim's body or bodily interests, including at its worst, killing them. The offenses we shall examine now are offenses against the victims' interests in property. The main offenses are listed on the slide: theft, burglary, fraud, and criminal damage.

This lecture covers theft. Theft is a statutory offense. Major elements are defined in Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. Read this section carefully. A person is guilty of theft if he dishonesty appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. This is your starting point for analyzing any problem question. If you want to analyze whether the defendant committed theft of th victim's property, apply the Statute to the fact and see where it takes you. Starting with the Actus Reus of theft, Section 3 defines what appropriation means. Section 4 defines what property means, and Section 5 defines what is meant by property belonging to another.

As with all offenses to analyze your problem, start with the Actus Reus, and decide whether it has been committed. Then you decide whether the fault element is present. In both cases, you need to analyze the facts of the problem to make this call. For theft, the Actus Reus is appropriating property belonging to another person. The Mens Rea or fault element is dishonesty coupled with an intention to permanently deprive the other person of their property.

Here is an example which you'll find in your textbook. It doesn't look like theft, does it? Take a look at this example. Adam, hairstylist to the stars, is asked by his friend, Demien, an artist, if Adam would be prepared to collect and sell Demien the hair of various celebrities for a future artistic composition. Adam says he will think about it. A few days later, following a visit from the famous pop group, Brass Monkeys, Adam telephones Demien and says he will sell Demien the discarded hair of the group members for £5,000.

An hour later, he changes his mind and throws the hair away. Has Adam stolen the hair? As I said, it doesn't look like theft, does it? Your job as a lawyer is to make sure this requires you to apply the Statute. Starting with the Actus Reus, has Adam appropriated property belonging to another person? This depends on the answer to three separate questions based upon the facts of our problem. Question one: is discarded hair property? Question two: if it is property, has Adam appropriated it and if so, how? Question three: if he has appropriated the hair, did this hair belong to another person when he appropriated it and if so, who?

The first question we ask is: is hair property? Look at Section 4, it tells us that property includes money and all other property, real or personal, including things in action and other intangible property. Well, clearly, hair is not money, and it is not real property, which means land, is then personal property, like a wallet, a key or a car is personal property. Clearly, before it has been cut, it is not personal property, but part of a person's body. Does it become personal property simply

because it has been cut and fallen to the floor? You'll find the answer to that question in the Actus Reus section of topic 12.

Question two. So the next question that we ask is if Adam has appropriated the hair. This depends, of course, on what appropriation means. You probably think it means has Adam taken it, but let's look at what Section 3 says. Section 3: any assumption by a person of the rights of an owner amounts to an appropriation, and this includes where he has come by the property innocently or not without stealing it, any later assumption of a right to it by keeping or dealing with it as owner.

As you can see, appropriation is a much wider concept than simply a taking. Section 3 tells us that you can appropriate property even when you've combined innocently, as Adam has done here when he cuts this hair. Section 3 tells us the appropriation means simply assuming rights of ownership over the property. This starts to look bad for Adam since he's done two things with the hair that only owners are allowed to do. First, he's offered to sell it. Second, he's thrown it away. One way or the other, he seems to have appropriated the hair. Assuming, of course, it counts as property.

Question three, Adam can only steal the hair if it belongs to someone else, does it? If so, who? Section 5 describes property as belonging to any person having possession or control of it or having any proprietary right or interest, not being an equitable interest, or rising only from an agreement to transfer or grant an interest. Forget about that last little bit. Property belongs to any person having possession or control of it or having any proprietary right or interest in it.

So the answer to this question of who it belongs to is not at all obvious. First, it might belong to the group, after all, it came from their heads. Does that not give them a proprietary right or interest in it that's required by Section 5? Second, it might belong to no one at all since the hair and any interest in it seem to have been abandoned in the shop by the group members. Again, it might belong to Adam since he was instrumental in turning it from body into the property and it was abandoned in his shop, so he is now in possession or control of it, within the meaning of Section 5, who does the hair belong to? You'll find the answers to these questions in the Actus Reus section of topic 12.

Now, we turn to the Mens Rea. Question one: does Adam, when he appropriates the property, intend to permanently deprive the owner, whoever it is of it? Let's have a look at Section 6, but before we do that, I want to explain to you what an intention to permanently deprive means. An intention to permanently deprive the other means exactly that. A person does not commit theft of property if their intention is not to take the property permanently. That is if they simply want to borrow the property or use it temporarily.

However, Section 6 provides for 2 situations where an intention to permanently deprive exists despite appearances to the contrary. Look at Section 6. Section 6 tells us that the person is to be treated as having an intention to permanently deprive the owner of his property. If his intention is to treat the thing as his own to dispose of, regardless of the other's right. Forget the rest of Section 6, it's not relevant to our case.

In this case, the prosecution may say that by offering the hair's sale, offering the hair away, Adam does show that his intention is to treat the thing the hair that is as his own to dispose off, regardless of the true owners' rights, so it comes within Section 6. You will need to read topic 12 Mens Rea to help you decide whether this element may be present. Second question on Mens Rea: was Adam dishonest in what he did? Look at Section 2(1).

Section 2(1) tells us what dishonesty is not. It doesn't tell us what it is, it tells us what it's not. It says, "An appropriation is not dishonest when a person appropriates property in the belief, (a), that he has, in law, the right to deprive the other of it on behalf of himself of a third person, or (b), that he would have the others consent if the other knew of the appropriation and the circumstances of

it, or (c), that the person to whom the property belongs cannot be discovered by taking reasonable steps."

The question that we're asking is does Adam or may Adam have a one of the three beliefs? Now, Adam may well argue here that here he was not determined first because Section 2(1)(a), he thought he can do what he likes with the hair. After all, it had been left in his shop, or perhaps, because of Section 2(1)(b), he thought the band members would consent to him taking it. Why wouldn't they? Did they want the hair back? If all else fails, he may argue that ordinary people would not find him to have been dishonest, which is the standard test for dishonesty and theft.

Once again, to help you understand this test and Section 2, you will need to look at topic 12, 1, 2. Concluding remark. I hope this lecture helped you to understand that when analyzing theft problems, you need to start with the Statute and to use your topic reading to help you analyze your way through to conclusion on theft problems.


## Mini lecture 2 - THEFT: APPROPRIATING PROPERTY

Prof William Wilson


The definition of theft given by Section 1 of the Theft Act of 1968 states as follows. A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. This mini-lecture concerns the actus reus of theft, namely the appropriation of property belonging to another person. It concentrates on one aspect of the actus reus, namely the appropriation.

Before we turn to the appropriation, it will be helpful to remind ourselves of what can be the subject matter of a theftuous appropriation, namely property. What is property? For the purpose of this lecture, property includes money and anything which can be bought or sold or made the subject of a gift, including personal property, objects, and assets of one kind or another. In this lecture, I'm going to explain how a person appropriates property.

Obviously, one may appropriate property by taking it, but the Theft Act of 1968 defines appropriation far wider than this. Section 3 of the Theft Act reads as follows, "any assumption by a person of the rights of an owner amounts to an appropriation, and this includes, where he has come by the property, innocently or not, without stealing it, any later assumption of a right to it by keeping or dealing with it as owner". How might a person appropriate property, which he already possesses? On the next slide, I shall provide two examples.

Take a look at these illustrations. Adam finds a wallet, picks it up, and decides to take it to the police station. On the way there, he changes his mind and decides to keep it. Then Eve lends Adam her book. After a few weeks, Adam thinks Eve has forgotten about the book and gives it to his friend, Cain. In both these cases, Adam has come by property innocently. In the first case, a wallet, in the second case, a book. In both cases, he later appropriates this property. In the first case by keeping it, in the second case by giving it away. Both actions are examples of assuming rights of ownership over property. In both cases, Adam is effectively saying to himself, "This is my property now, I can deal with it as I like." The two illustrations just considered show that one can appropriate property that is already in one's possession, but this is only one instance of how a person may appropriate property. Section 3 defines appropriation as any assumption of the rights of the owner.

This means that if a person does something in relation to property, which only the owner is permitted to do, then that person appropriates the property for the purpose of the law of theft. There is no need for taking. For example, in *Pitham*, A appropriated B's refrigerator when he offered it for sale while the owner was in prison. He wasn't in possession of it, but offering property for sale is one of the owner's rights and he had assumed that right.

What are the rights of ownership? The rights of an owner include the right to possess, sell, give away, use, destroy, pawn, lend, or modify property. Anyone who assumes any of these rights over someone else's property appropriates it. It does not require anything major. For example, in *Morris*, changing the price tag on a tin in a supermarket was held to be an appropriation of the tin.

In what ways can rights be assumed? Here are some examples. Lending someone a book one has oneself borrowed, removing a wallet from a pocket, drawing a check against someone else's bank account, eating, smoking, destroying, drinking the property, changing the price tag on a tin in a

supermarket. It is very important to understand that an appropriation may occur although the victim consents or authorizes the defendant to assume a right of ownership over the property.

In *Lawrence*, a foreign student who spoke no English, at the end of a journey, handed over her purse to the taxi driver. He took more money from the purse than the journey permitted. The House of Lords ruled that he had appropriated the money, although he took it with the owner's consent. This was a case where there had been a fraud on the part of the taxi driver, and so the transaction was flawed and could be set aside. Does the same principle apply where the transaction was perfectly valid.

What if there was no fraud? Let's have a look at this example. D, an antique dealer, goes into a junk shop owned by V and spots a vase on sale for £100. D however, knows that it is a piece of 18th-century Delftware worth £500,000. He buys the vase for £100. Does D appropriate the vase? This was the question to be decided in *Hinks* where the alleged appropriation was an outright gift.

Let's look at the facts of *Hinks*. The appellant befriended a man called Mr. Dolphin. She encouraged him to make her gifts of money from his bank account. She was convicted of theft of this money, although there was no evidence of duress or deception or that he had parted with the money otherwise than by gift. One of the questions which the House of Lords had to decide was whether the act as rare as a theft was present. Specifically, had Mrs. Hinks appropriated Mr. Dolphin's money? She argued that she had not appropriated the money for the simple reason that she'd been given it.

The House of Lords concluded that the fact that the money had been given to her did not prevent her from appropriating it, which she did by assuming ownership rights over it. *Hinks* is a very strange case. Does it mean that any person who buys or is given property in unusual circumstances is guilty of theft? The answer is no. The prosecution must prove the appropriation with dishonest and most consensual assumptions of the rights of an owner by way of gift or purchase will not be dishonest because of the operation of Section 2, Subsection 1 of the Theft Act of 1968.

Section 2 of the Theft Act of 1968 tells us that a person does not act dishonestly, A, if he appropriates the property in the belief that he has in law the right to deprive the other of it on behalf of himself or a third person, or B, if he appropriates the property in the belief that he would have the other's consent if the other knew of the appropriation and the circumstances of it. It seems therefore that by Section 2, Mrs. Hinks was not acting dishonestly, but the very least she appropriated the property in the belief that she had the legal right to deprive Mr. Dolphin of it.

I suppose, however, that most people would think that notwithstanding Section 2, she was acting dishonestly. She may have thought the law was on her side, but she was acting immorally and she would've known this. Nevertheless, Section 2 tells us that she does not act dishonestly in law. A bit of a problem there.

## 12.2 Burglary

Section 9 of the Theft Act 1968 creates two separate offences of burglary: an inchoate crime of ulterior intent where there is no need to prove the commission of the substantive offence  $(s.9(1)(a))$ ; and a complete crime where proof of the commission of an offence is of the essence  $(s.9(1)(b))$ . Section  $9(1)$  provides:

A person is guilty of burglary if-

(a) he enters any building or part of a building as a trespasser and with intent to commit any such offence as is mentioned in subsection (2) below; or

(b) having entered any building or part of it as a trespasser he steals or attempts to steal anything in the building or that part of it or inflicts or attempts to inflict on any person therein any grievous bodily harm.

Since both  $s.9(1)(a)$  and  $s.9(1)(b)$  have 'entry of a building as a trespasser' as common features for burglary these will be dealt with first before we cover the specifics of the two offences.

### 12.2.1 Actus reus: burglary

In order to be quilty of burglary, D must enter a building or part of a building as a trespasser. The following questions must be asked, therefore, in connection with both forms of the offence.

- Was there an entry? If yes,
- did the person entering enter as a trespasser? If yes,
- was the entry to a building or part of a building?

#### What counts as entry?

To enter premises, entry of the whole person is not necessary; however, the entry must be 'effective'. This does not necessarily mean that the entry has to be capable of enabling the commission of an offence, but this helps. It is a question of fact for the jury. In Brown [1985] Crim LR 212, it was confirmed that, contrary to the earlier authority of Collins [1973] QB 100, the entry need not be substantial. So D's conviction for burglary was upheld on the basis of him having smashed the window of a shop and having leant in, feet still on the pavement, to take goods from inside the window. In Ryan [1996] Crim LR 320, on comparable facts, the conviction was upheld, although D, who had become stuck in the window, had not managed to penetrate sufficiently far into the premises to steal anything.

Did the person entering enter as a trespasser?

Entry will be as a trespasser if the entry is made without the consent, express or implied, of the occupier, and without statutory authority. The question of whether the defendant had entered as a trespasser was of key concern in Collins. The defendant, intending to rape V, climbed naked up a ladder and perched on her windowsill. V mistook him in the dark for her boyfriend and welcomed him in. It was not clear how far into the room D was when he received his invitation, but the jury found that his entry was sufficient for a conviction. However, the court made clear that if he was still on the windowsill when invited in, he would not have entered as a trespasser and so could not be guilty of burglary.

Since Collins, it has also been decided that those who enter premises in excess of authority are trespassers on those premises. This covers those who may have permission to be in the property but exceed the permission by doing something which they were not invited to do. So, in Jones and Smith [1976] 1 WLR 672, it was burglary for a son to enter his father's house intending to steal a TV. Although he had general authority to enter the premises, that authority was vitiated by entering in excess of the presumed terms of his father's consent.

#### **Study task 8**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 16.4.B 'Entry as a trespasser' and answer the following questions.

- a. Raffles enters Wizzo supermarket intending to buy a razor. As he has little money he decides, before entering, that if the razor costs more than the £3 in his pocket, he will steal the razor. Has Raffles committed burglary?
- b. Did Collins have the mens rea for burglary upon entering the room?
- c. In the light of Jones and Smith would Collins now be deemed to have entered as a trespasser, assuming Collins knew of the woman's mistake?

Show feedback

- a. Does Raffles enter as a trespasser? This depends upon whether his conditional intention means that he is entering in excess of his authority.
- b. It would appear so: see Collins.

Was the entry to a building or part of a building?

A building is not defined in the Theft Act 1968, although s.9(4) states that it includes 'a vehicle or vessel constructed or adapted for human habitation' - for example, houseboats, canal barges and caravans. A consensus holds that a building must be some form of structure with a degree of permanence capable of being entered. This

would cover barns, churches, shops, warehouses and even portable cabins such as freezer containers, and also outbuildings, but probably not tents (B and S v Leathley [1979] Crim LR 314).

A person who enters a building lawfully may become a trespasser in relation to a part of that building where they have no licence to go. Parts of buildings include living rooms, service rooms, bathrooms and roofs. In the case of Walkington [1979] 1 WLR 1169, it was held that a person lawfully visiting a department store was guilty of burglary when she went behind a shop counter to steal from the till. This area, being clearly defined, was 'part of a building' and she, having no authority to be there, entered as a trespasser.

### 12.2.2 Mens rea: burglary

For both offences of burglary, the defendant must know they are a trespasser or be reckless as to whether they are trespassing at the time of entry. They must also have the relevant mens rea for the crime they commit or intend to commit: for example, dishonesty and the intention to permanently deprive in the case of theft.

#### Section 9(1)(a) burglary

The s.9(1)(a) offence requires intention to commit one of the ulterior offences. It will be charged when there is evidence that D had entered with the relevant intent but had not yet consummated the proposed crime. In everyday language, a person can be a burglar without actually stealing anything or causing any harm. The most common ulterior intent is the intent to steal. Following Jones and Smith, this has the surprising consequence that a person who enters a shop intending to steal from it commits burglary immediately upon entering the shop, because, by having this intent, they enter in excess of authority and therefore enter as a trespasser.

It is important to remember that it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove entry with intent to steal, although, of course, this will usually be the case. A person who enters with intent to commit any of the offences specified commits burglary. By s.9(2) these are offences of:

- stealing anything in the building or part of the building in question, or
- inflicting on any person therein any grievous bodily harm, or
- doing unlawful damage to the building or anything therein.

It is not burglary, therefore, to enter premises as a trespasser with intent to commit fraud, rape or cause actual bodily harm.

#### Section 9(1)(b) burglary

The s.9(1)(b) offence does not require proof of an ulterior intent at the time of entering as a trespasser. It is charged only where there is evidence that the substantive offence has been committed. Since the offence has been committed, proof of the ulterior intent upon entering as a trespasser is unnecessary. This form of burglary is more restricted in its coverage than  $s.9(1)(a)$ . It is committed where, having entered as a trespasser, the entrant:

- steals or attempts to steal, or
- inflicts or attempts to inflict grievous bodily harm.

It does not cover, therefore, the case of a person who enters premises as a trespasser and then causes criminal damage to the premises or inflicts bodily harm less than grievous bodily harm. In such a case, the prosecution must charge the substantive offence. For the s.9(1)(b) offence, the prosecution must prove not only the entry as trespasser but also all of the elements of the ulterior offence.

#### Aggravated burglary under s 10 of the Theft Act 1968

Under  $s.10(1)$ :

(1) A person is guilty of aggravated burglary if he commits any burglary and at the time has with him any firearm or imitation firearm, any weapon of offence, or any explosive; and for this purpose -

(a) 'firearm' includes an airgun or air pistol, and 'imitation firearm' means anything which has the appearance of being a firearm, whether capable of being discharged or not; and

(b) 'weapon of offence' means any article made or adapted for use for causing injury to or incapacitating a person, or intended by the person having it with him for such use; and

(c) 'explosive' means any article manufactured for the purpose of producing a practical effect by explosion, or intended by the person having it with him for that purpose.

The mere fact that the defendant has with them at the time of the burglary an object that could be used as a weapon of offence, such as a crowbar or knife, does not mean the offence is committed. The prosecution must either show that the article's primary purpose is for causing injury, such as a gun or hunting knife, or has been adapted for such use, or, in the case of articles such as crowbars, knives, etc. that it was intended for such use by the defendant. See R v Eletu and White [2018] EWCA Crim 599.

The relevant time for possessing the weapon depends on whether it is a  $s(1)(a)$  offence or a  $s(1)(b)$  offence. If (a), then possession must be at time of entry; if (b), possession must be at the time the ulterior offence is committed. In O'Leary (1986) 82 Cr App R 341, D entered a house without a weapon. Once inside he took a knife from the kitchen and took it upstairs to effect the burglary. D's conviction was upheld on appeal. It was held that, since the offence was charged under  $s.9(1)(b)$ , there was no requirement that he had the knife at the time of entry.

## Sample examination question 1
**Question**

Aftab, finding he has no money for his bus fare, takes £5 from Erina, his housemate's wallet, leaving a note saying that he will repay it on his return. Erina has told him on a previous occasion not to do this. When he gets on the bus the driver tells him to pay later as the bus is running late. Aftab gets off the bus without paying, reasoning that others would have done the same. Later he spots a basket of apples on the street outside a house. Above the basket is a sign saying. 'I have too many apples for my own use. Please take some but leave some for others.' Aftab takes 50 apples leaving only three in the basket. He then goes to a fruit and vegetable shop where he sells the apples to the owner. He then buys some vegetables, using Erina's £5 note. Next Aftab goes to an ATM cash dispenser where he withdraws £5 to repay Erina, although he knows he has no funds in his bank account to cover the withdrawal. He returns home and puts the £5 back in Erina's wallet. Erina sees him do this and gets angry. She accuses Aftab of being a thief, to which he replies 'I'm not a thief. I gave you the money back. That is not theft and anyway it is not dishonest'. Erina replies 'Well I think it is, since you knew I wouldn't agree'.

This is a straightforward problem question on theft, requiring consideration of the various elements of theft. In answers to problem questions on theft, having a clear structure applying actus reus and mens rea separately pays off. There are 5 elements to consider and considering each separately is good practice.

Theft is a statutory offence under s.1 of the TA 1968 (TA), and it is important to know and apply the key sections of the TA 1968. Despite being a statutory offence, there is a high volume of case law on theft. It is essential to know and apply the case law on each element of theft to do well.

Here are points of what could have been discussed for each scenario. Please note that this is an indicative answer only and merit would be given for any high quality, relevant application:

### Erin's £5: theft?

Consider all the five elements of theft and focus on dishonesty. Section 2 of TA is inapplicable and so whether Aftab is dishonest depends upon the new common law test of *Ivey*. Your discussion should take into account the conversation between Aftab and Erina, which indicates that there is an issue as to whether Aftab's conduct is

objectively dishonest. The intention to permanently deprive is also at issue but you should have said that the Velumyl principle means that if the £5 returned is a different note from that taken the intention is satisfied but the facts do not make this clear.

### Bus fare: making off or theft?

Theft is the correct charge but was inapplicable due to lack of temporal coincidence of *mens rea* and *actus reus*, e.g. Corcoran v Whent. Making off without payment is therefore the offence to charge (Topic 13). There are two issues here. First, dishonesty. See discussion above and remember to apply the facts. Also, has he made off from the spot where payment is due? This requires you to consider where this spot is, e.g. Moberley v Alsop. You might also consider, although this was not required, whether a charge of obtaining services dishonestly is chargeable. Again, the question as to whether *actus reus* and *mens rea* coincided arises.

### Taking apples: theft?

Consider all the five elements of theft and focus on appropriation. The main issue concerns appropriation and you should make the point that a taking with the owner's consent does not prevent an appropriation, e.g. Hinks. Guilt therefore depends upon whether the taking was dishonest, which required you to refer to s.2(1)(a) or (b) Theft Act 1968? If not, you should consider dishonesty as per Ivey.

### Selling apples: theft?

Consider all the five elements of theft and focus on belonging to another. Selling the apples cannot be theft if the apples no longer belong to the previous owner which, given the fact that they were gifted, suggest that they do not, e.g. Williams v Phillips. Note, however, that it could be considered to be a conditional gift, which means the original owner might still retain some rights over the apples. If this is the case, has the condition been satisfied? I did not expect anybody to make this point but if you had you are well on your way to being a top-class lawyer!

### ATM machine: theft?

Consider all the five elements of theft and focus on appropriation. There are two possibilities: a thing in action (i.e. the debt owed by the bank to Aftab); or the money itself. Here, since Aftab has no funds in his account, the bank does not owe him a debt and therefore the property appropriated is the actual money taken from the machine not a chose in action, e.g. Chodorek v Poland (2017). The only issue is dishonesty. You could also have mentioned fraud by false representation, namely the implied representation made to the machine that he was authorised to use it. See s.2 Fraud Act.

## Exam question activity 1

Try to answer the following examination question:

- 1. On pay day, Ken notices that he has been overpaid by £10. He is a charitable man and he decides to donate the money to a local children's charity which helps children who have suffered abuse.
- 2. Jayan and his girlfriend have been dating for a month. Jayan borrows his girlfriend's iPad to use on the train journey into work without telling her. He returns it three weeks later having drained the battery.
- 3. Chidi takes a £20 note from her husband's wallet without asking him for the money. She intends to replace the money at the end of the week when she gets paid. She spends the money on a book. On Friday, she places £20 in her husband's wallet.
- 4. Emily is shopping in the local department store. She sees earrings she really likes but cannot afford. She takes the earrings from the shelf and walks away quickly, intending to steal them. Just as she is putting them in her pocket, she changes her mind and places the earrings back on the shelf.

Consider whether Ken, Jayan, Chidi and Emily are guilty of theft in the following circumstances.

A tip for the future! When tackling multi-part questions, it is important to remember that each scenario is roughly the same level of difficulty, therefore, you should consider and answer each scenario roughly in same length and level of detail. In answers to problem questions on theft, having a clear structure applying actus reus and mens rea separately pays off. There are 5 elements to consider and considering each separately is good practice.

Feedback is available but try to answer on your own first. Your response will not match the feedback exactly but you should compare your performance with it and consider whether you took all the relevant factors into account.
