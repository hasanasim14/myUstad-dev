## Theft: The Appropriation

- A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. S 1 Theft Act 1968
- ACTUS REUS appropriation of property belonging to another

## Property

- S.4 TA 1968
- "Property" includes money and all other property, real or personal, including things in action and other intangible property.'

### Appropriate Property

*Appropriation*: "any assumption by a person of the rights of an owner amounts to an appropriation, and this includes, where he has come by the property (innocently or not) without stealing it, any later assumption of a right to it by keeping or dealing with it as owner." (s.3 (1))

*1. Coming by property innocently and then assuming rights to it.*

 Illustrations

- Adam finds a wallet. He picks it up and decides to take t to the police station. On the way there he changes his mind and decides to keep it.
- Eve lends Adam her book. After a few weeks Adam thinks Eve has forgotten about the book, and gives it to his friend Cain.

 How else may a person assume rights of ownership?

- *No need for a taking. Pitham and Hehl (1976) 65 CrApp R 45.*
- *No need to be in possession of the property: Pitham and Hehl (1976)*

 What are the rights of ownership ?

Rights of ownership include the right to:
• Possess, sell, give away, use, destroy, pawn, lend, modify property *Morris* (1984)

### In what ways can rights be assumed?

- *1. Lending someone a book one has oneself borrowed.*
- *2. Removing a wallet from a pocket (Easom)*
- *3. Drawing a cheque against someone else's bank account (Chan).*
- *4. Eating/ smoking / destroying drinking the property*
- *5. Changing the price tag on a tin in a supermarket. (Morris)*

### Consent

- An appropriation may occur although the victim consents or authorises D to assume a right of ownership over the property.
- *Lawrence v MPC [1972] AC 626 HL; R v Morris (1984) AC 320; R v Gomez* [1993] AC 442

### What if there was no fraud?

- *D, an antique dealer, goes into a junk shop owned by V and spots a vase on sale for £100. D knows that it is a piece of 18th century Delftware worth £500k. He buys the vase for £100. Does D appropriate the vase?*
- *This was the question to be decided in Hinks (2000) where the alleged appropriation was an outright gift*

### *R v Hinks*

- Appropriation of Gifted Property (*R v Hinks*)
- Does this mean that any person who buys or is given property in unusual circumstances is guilty of theft?
- NO. Prosecution must prove the appropriation was dishonest and most consensual assumptions of the rights of an owner by way of gift or purchase will not be dishonest because of section 2(1) Theft Act 1968

### S. 2 Theft Act 1968

- A person does not act dishonestly
  - a) if he appropriates the property in the belief that he has in law the right to deprive the other of it, on behalf of himself or of a third person; or
  - b) if he appropriates the property in the belief that he would have the other's consent if the other knew of the appropriation and the circumstances of it;
