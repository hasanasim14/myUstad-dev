## Introduction

The criminal law has no business punishing us for our thoughts, only for our actions or deeds. Even a criminal attempt requires the defendant to have acted upon their decision to kill someone, injure them or steal their property. Until then, they are free to plan the crime, obtain the poison and reconnoitre the place contemplated for the commission of the crime. It is only when they put their plan into action that the criminal law can get involved.

## Lecture plus - Actus reus Dr Laura Lammasniemi

Welcome to this Lecture Plus lecture on Actus Reus. I am Dr Laura Lammasniemi. This might be the first Lecture Plus lecture that you are listening to. This Lecture Plus is going to be introducing you to a core concept in criminal law, Actus Reus. The Lecture Plus format has two equally important parts. The first is the lecture itself, the one you are listening to at the moment, and the second is the discussion forum. I have set a series of questions for you and for all your fellow students in the model to discuss in the forum. These questions range form general discuss questions to a past exam question. You can write brief notes as a response to some of these questions or full exam type answers if you want to practice writing. You can also comment on other people's posts and engage in conversation on those topics with your fellow students. In other words, you can participate as much as you like or as little as you like.

This lecture begins by explaining the importance of Actus Reus to establishing criminal liability. It discusses different types of Actus Reus focusing on the conduct element and on the result crimes. We will then cover omission liability and finally focus on causation. This lecture ends by introducing a past exam question that is also posted on the forum for you to discuss. Each of the sections of this lecture is divided by a header so you can pick up if you don't want to listen to the full lecture in one go, you can pick it up from one of the sections.

We will begin by introduction to Actus Reus. In criminal law, ordinarily to establish criminal liability, you must show three things.You must show that the defendant had the Actus Reus of the offense in question that the defendant had the Mens Rea of the offense in question and that he had no defense available. While the Actus Reus usually provides a clear image of the kind of conduct or result that was involved in specific criminal offense, the Mens Rea of the crime provides the necessary mental element which make sure that the specific conduct or the consequence was particularly blameworthy.

Mens Rea helps to ensure that only blameworthy are punished, and it also helps to distinguish between different types of crimes, both Actus Reus and Mens Rea that is all the elements of the offense must be established for criminal liability to occur. For example, for someone to be held liable for murder, it is not enough for them to perform an act that causes death. They must cause the death while possessing the intention to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm.

An unintentional killing may still be criminalisable, but it is not murder. For every offense, you should be able to identify what the Actus Reus and the Mens Rea requirements are. We will now move on to consider what Actus Reus and Mens Rea look like in practice before focusing on the key elements of Actus Reus. Let's use the example of theft under the Theft Act of 1968, section one. Section one of the Theft Act defines theft as - a person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. Take a moment to think about this definition. Maybe you can pause he video and see if you can identify what is the Actus Reus and what is the Mens Rea of this definition.

The easiest way to often identify the elements is to start with Mens Rea and consider anything that is relevant to the defendant's state mind. Anything that is left behind is the Actus Reus, so the definition of theft is a person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. The easiest way to identify what

is and is not Actus Reus is actually to start with Mens Rea. Consider which aspect does the crime deal with defendants state mind and consider those, and then what you are left with is the Actus Reus. In theft, both dishonesty and intention are the Mens Rea elements. To fulfill the Mens Rea, the defendant must be dishonest and he must also have the intention to permanently deprive the owner. Those two are the Mens Rea elements. Then we are left with the elements of Actus Reus appropriation property and belonging to someone else. You will see here that only appropriation is action or an act of the defendant. Both property and belonging to someone else are part of Actus Reus, but instead of action, they rely to the circumstances of the crime.

Actus Reus is effectively all the elements of the crime that do not involve Mens Rea, the state of mind of the defendant. It can include circumstances like we have seen in the context of theft, or it can include a result. I will say a few words about that soon, but first I want to say a few words about acts. Usually Actus Reus identifies the conduct that criminal law considers to be harmful. This would include things like causing physical harm, causing death, or taking something that belongs to another person. The conduct part of the crime is always Actus Reus. In other words, Actus Reus on one offense tells us what we can and what we cannot do. It sets boundaries of acceptable and unacceptable behavior.

The Mens Rea element then and the defenses, they help us and the criminal justice system to determine if the person was liable for the wrongful act that he did, and if so, how liable was he? Let's take an example of two men standing in the street. Let's call them Andrew and Sid. Andrew was to sit to the ground, Sid hits his head on the payment, and he dies. The Actus Reus of the crime here is the unlawful conduct of pushing Sid to the ground and the result is the death that was caused by the push.

Andrew's action has caused Sid's death, and so Actus Reus elements are clearly met for the crime, but it's someone with crime we must also consider his mental state. Depending on his state of mind at the time, his liability will differ. If he intended to push Sid in order to injure or to kill him he would've the highest form of culpability as he intended to Sid to get hurt, and he could be liable for murder. If he pushed Sid in the heat of an argument or by accident, he'll be less culpable or perhaps not culpable at all. It's important to remember he had the same conduct, the same act. It can lead to different types or no liability at all depending on the Mens Rea of the defendant.

When we are considering what constitutes an acts or conduct, one of the key things to bear in mind is a conduct must be voluntary. In the case of *Bratty*, the House of Lords said the following, and I will quote here, "No act is punishable if it is done involuntarily. An involuntary act in this context means an act which is done by the muscles without any control of the mind, such as a spasm, a reflex action or a convulsion or an act that is done by a person who is not conscious of what he's doing. Certain act that is done while suffering from a concussion or while sleepwalking."

In this case, Bratty, the appellant had strangled and killed a young woman whilst giving her a lift. He had left her body on the side of the road, and then he had driven home. He argued in his appeal that he was suffering from psychomotor epilepsy and at the time of the killing, a terrible feeling came over him, and he was not conscious of his actions. He wished to raise the defense of automatism, but the trial just refused to allow this to be put to the jury and direct the jury towards insanity.The jury rejected the insanity defense and convicted him of murder. His appeal was not successful and the House of Lords said he was rightly convicted, but they also confirmed and reaffirmed the important precedent that no act is punishable, if it is truly done involuntarily.

Actus Reus can perhaps be best defined as readily deductively as all the elements of the crime that is not the Mens Rea, as I have said before. This can include conduct, circumstances, and the result. The core element of criminal liability is some prohibitive conduct as discussed both as above.

Identifying an act therefore is a key task for the prosecution. Actus Reus is more than an act though. An Actus Reus can comprise of the circumstances to crime. For example, the definition of murder is the unlawful killing of a human being under Queen's Peace with the intention to kill or to cause previous bodily harm. Here, the intention to kill or to cause previous bodily harm are the Mens Rea, the mental elements. Actus Reus is everything else. Our lawful killing is the prohibited conduct, but the circumstance elements of the killed having been to be a human being and that the killing took place under Queen's Peace are all the circumstance elements of Actus Reus or we can consider is our earlier example of theft. We had three Actus Reus elements. These were appropriation, property and that the property belonged to someone else. Here, only appropriation, the act of taking or appropriating is a conduct element and the others are circumstances.

It is essential for the definition of theft that the property belongs to someone else, but the defendant himself has no control of that circumstances, yet liability for theft cannot exist if the property does not belong to someone else. Circumstances can be a very important part of Actus Reus.

Thirdly, a prohibited result can be an important part of Actus Reus. Result here means the unlawful result. Result crimes are crimes where result rather than the defendant's conduct is criminalized. These includes crimes such as criminal damage or homicide. It is not unlawful to throw a stone yet if you throw a stone and break a window, you might have committed criminal damage. The liability here is formed through the result, the broken window, rather than the action. For result crimes, It is always necessary to show a causal link between the defendant's actions and the result. Causation is only an issue for assault crimes and you do not need to consider it for conduct crimes or state of affairs. We will discuss this shortly further.

First, we will move to an important part of Actus Reus, which is omission liability. We will now move to the second part of our lecture. This will focus on omission liability. To get started, I want us to briefly consider what is an act and what is an omission. The case that illustrates this well and it also illustrates the difficulties the courts have had in making this distinction is the case of *Airedale NHS Trust v Bland* from 1993. Bland is a very tragic case like unfortunately are many of the cases that we study.

Tony Bland was a young supporter of Liverpool Football Club and he was seriously injured in the Hillsborough football disaster. In the Hillsborough disaster 97 football fans died after being crushed in a stampede. Tony Bland was one of the fans who were very seriously injured in the stamped, he was crushed against the barriers, which led him to be in a persistent vegetated state. He was been in this state for three years and he was being kept alive on life support machines. His brain-stem was still functioning, which controlled his heartbeat, breathing and digestion. Technically he was still alive. However, he was not conscious and he did not have any hope of recovery. The hospital, with the consent of his parents applied for a declaration that it might lawfully discontinue all life sustaining treatment. This meant withdrawing ventilation and nutrition and ultimately leaving him to die. This was a very, very important case and it would come to set the precedent that in such circumstances, medical staff is allowed to withdraw treatment. Here the court held that withdrawing nutrition, withdrawing ventilation, these were not positive acts, but these were an omission.

The court said, "I must, however, stress at this point that the law draws a crucial distinction between cases in which a doctor decides not to provide or continue to provide for his patient treatment or care, which could or might prolong his life, and those in which he decides by an example of administering a lethal drug actively bringing his patient's life to an end." Here the court drew a clear line between active euthanasia and giving life ending drugs. They said that this is an act. This is forbidden. Euthanasia, giving life-ending drugs is an act and therefore it is forbidden . Withdrawing treatment was an omission and this was allowed as it brought things to the natural state of being, how things would've been if there had been no treatment at all.

When we're assessing where you think can be a liability for omissions, we must start by recognizing there is no general duty to act in English law. Unlike some European countries, England does not have a good samaritan rule. This means that if you see children drinking like we have here or taking drugs, or if you see a stranger drowning in a shallow pool, or even if you see a neighbor having a heart attack in the street you are not legally required to do anything to assist. Not even to call an ambulance.

There might be a moral duty to do so and most people would hopefully call an ambulance but if you do nothing on work on by there is no criminal liability for so doing. How does criminal liability for omissions arise then? Firstly an offense must be capable of being committed by omission. This means that not all offenses can be committed by an omission. For example an assault cannot be committed by omission as with the case of Fagan. Most offenses can be committed by omission however including theft, murder, and criminal damage. Secondly, the circumstances must be such that they create a legal duty to act. Duty to act arises only from a specific set of circumstances. There can be certain relationships out of which duty to act arises and we will look at these circumstances next.

These would be things like having a familiar bond. If that duty exists then failing to act is a criminal offense. For example there would be no criminal liability for you walking past your neighbor having a heart attack but if that person is your husband or your wife then the duty would arise. Thirdly, if that relationship or duty to act existed then there must be a clear breach of duty before liability can exist. This means that failing to act when you should have or a reasonable person would have acted. If this criteria myth then there can be a liability to failing to act that is just as liable as doing a positive act.

Finally ordinary rules of acts and omissions apply here. This means that the failure to act must be voluntary and that the harm that followed was caused by the omission. As established there is usually no duty to act and a liability only arises where there is a duty due to the existing relationship between the victim and the defendant or due to the circumstances.

I have given you here on the screen most important of those duties with some case law examples, the first of these duties is the statutory duty. There are certain statutes such as health and safety laws or laws dealing with children and young people that created duties to act. The second category is contractual duties. A good illustration of this is the case of *Pitwood*. Pitwood was employed by a railway company to look after a gate at a level crossing. The defendant lifted the gate to allow a car to pass and then went off to lunch failing to put it back down. A train later collided with a horse and a cart killing the driver. Defendant was held to be liable for the death of the train driver as it was his contractual duty to close the gate. People whose job is to look after other people like bodyguards or lifeguards at the beach they must do so. There are also certain jobs where the duty of care is embedded into the role. These would be roles like the police officers as we saw in the case of *Dytham* or the medical professions.

Another important duty category is that of a special relationship. A special relationship exists between a parent and a child. If a parent allows a child to die like in the case of *Lowe*, they could be held liable for their death. A special relationship covers intimate family relationships such as a parent and a child or spouses. Really if you think about this vesting idea of a nuclear family. There are some questions about how far the special relationship goes and it seems for example the step siblings are not covered by this duty.

So far the categories have been quite obvious and quite straightforward and now we'll move on to more complex categories strongest of which is perhaps that voluntary assumption of duty that you will see on your screens here. Anyone who assumes the care of another person creates a duty to continue their care or to seek alternative arrangements. Once their duty is assumed, a person cannot leave the person in their care without care. This does not mean that the person must be the primary caregiver forever but they must let the social authorities, the medical authorities know if they cannot continue so alternative care can be arranged. The case of *Instan* illustrates as well. Instan was looking after her elderly aunt and lived with her aunt. The aunt became ill and developed a gangrene in her leg. She was unable to move yet Instan did not provide her with food, not with care, nor did she arrange any medical support even though she continues to live in the

same house. Eventually, the aunt passed away due to lack of food, lack of care, and Instan was held responsible.

Another complex category is creating a dangerous situation. This is illustrated by cases like *Evans* and *Miller*. On the wee-lee you have a mini-lecture on the case of *Miller* that I was recommend that you listen to. In short, this means that if the defendant causes a dangerous situation, he has a duty to assist those who might be injured or to prevent damage that might occur as a consequence of the defendant's own actions.

The final category that is not always considered the category at all is the category of a continuing action. In a way, this continuing Act helps us to understand the extent of Actus Reus, but it can also be considered to be a duty category. The category is best explained through the case of *Fagan*. A policeman was directing a Fagan to park when a Fagan accidentally drove onto the policeman's foot. The policeman shouted at to get off, defendant refused to move. When he was charged with an offense afterwards, he argued that at the time of the Actus Reus, driving on his foot, he lacked the Mens Rea of any offense. This is purely accidental. Then when he informed the Mens Rea he lacked the Actus Reus, as he simply did nothing. The court rejected this argument. They held that driving on the foot and remaining there was part of a continuing act so he had a duty to move his car. Here we have the key categories under which a duty arises. It is important to know these categories and recognize them when you see them in problem questions, and of course in real life.

Finally, I want to say a few words about the nature of omission liability. Omission liability and whether it should be criminalized has attracted a great deal of controversy and legal commentary. There are two traditional opposing views on this. These are the conventional view and the social responsibility view. The current system we have of the system of no general duty to act is in line with the conventional view. According theorists such as Glanville Williams, there should be no general duty to act.

The proponents of the conventional views like Williams, they believe that imposing a duty to act would extend the scope of criminal liability too far. The primary aim of criminal law is to prevent wrongdoing. This they say would stretch the law too far. They also believe that there's a distinction to be made between acts and omissions, and that active wrongdoing is more culpable than a failure to act, and the law should reflect this.

Finally, one of the key arguments of the conventional view is that if there were to be a general duty this would infringe on people's autonomy and liberty. By needing to step in, needing to concern yourself with the affairs of others, this would automatically impose a duty that infringes on your own liberty. Many of those who have the conventional view believe that there remains a moral duty to act in the circumstances we have discussed but this moral duty should not be turned or extended into a legal duty.

A different perspective is put forward by those who believe in the social responsibility view. Unlike conventional view proponents, they argue that there is no real difference between acts and omissions. Criminal Law theorist Andrew Ashford is a proponent of the social responsibility view. He said in his article called *The scope of criminal liability for omissions*, that and I will quote him, "The general principle of criminal law should be that omissions liability should be possible if a duty is established because in those circumstances, there is no fundamental moral distinction between failing to perform an activity foreseen bad consequences and performing an activity identical for seeing bad consequences."

In addition to believing that there's no real difference between acts and omissions, those who put forward the social responsibility view, have argued that this is the morally right thing to do and it relates back to the social contract and how we all exist in a society. There should be a duty towards our neighbors and our fellow people and there is a collective good that can be gained from creating such duty. These views are undoubtedly opposing and both sides make important

arguments. This is an important discussion that is yet to be satisfactorily decided in law and in moral literature. You can find a question on this on the forum, and I would recommend you post your views and have a discussion with your fellow students about this.

We are now moving to the third part of this lecture and we will focus on causation. Causation in a sense means the causal link between the defendant's actions and the result. Consider this example. The defendant buys a gun with the aim of shooting the victim, he drives the victim's house, he points the gun at the victim and he fires the gun. The victim dies as a result of the gunshot. The causal link between the defendant's action that is firing the gun and the result that is the victim dying is clear. Causation here is easy to establish. The issue of causation generally does not present problems, often like in the example I had just given it is self-evident. Occasionally however, causal link might not be easy to identify because for example, there are number of contributory causes to the result.

The case of the defendant firing the gun at the victim and the victim dying is straightforward, but what about when the situation is less straightforward? Consider these examples. For example, what if the defendant fires the gun at the victim only to scare them and the bullet hits the victim's leg, the victim later dies in the hospital due to blood poisoning. Has the defendant caused the death here? Or imagine that the defendant and the victim are standing on the road and just as the defendant fired the gun, a car swerved from behind the bend and drove over the victim. The victim is instantly killed, but it's impossible to tell whether the crash or the gunshot killed him. Where is the causal link? Do we draw the causal link to the defendant's actions or the driver who came around the bend. Or to say to avoid the gunshot, the victim ducks and he falls and as he's falling he hits his head on the pavement or a rock and he dies because of a broken skull. The bullet didn't even touch the victim, yet the victim had died. In all of these scenarios, it could be that the defendant is still liable for the murder of victim as the chain of causation was not necessarily broken.

When we are thinking about causation in criminal law and in homicide cases, there are three things that you should always bear in mind. These are factual cause, legal cause and finally did anything break the chain of causation? Technically any breaks in the chain of causation comes under legal causation, but sometimes it is helpful to think about them separately to have that clarity in your application.

We will now discuss these three rules in order. The first thing to always consider when attempting to establish causation is factual causation. This is a test for the jury to decide. If there is no factual causation, there is no need to go on to consider other issues with causation, such as legal causation or new intervening act. Hart and Honore described factual cause as "an event or an act which makes a difference between something happening and not happening" in the 1959 book *Causation and the law*. The test to use when establishing causation in fact is the but-for test. In short but-for test to establish factual causation asks, but for the defendant's actions, would the harm have been caused?

For example, but for the defendant throwing a stone at the shop window, would the window have been broken? This is a relatively straightforward test and it normally does not pose too many difficulties for the jury. The but-for-test was first articulated in the case of *White*, therefore whenever applying the but-for-test you should use *White* as the key authority for the test and for factual causation. In the case of *White*, the defendant administered a poison to the victim who was his murder. Autopsy was performed and the autopsy discovered that the murder had died of a heart attack, not of the poison. The mother had not even known that she had drunk the poison and the poison was not the cause of the heart attack. This was simply coincidental. Applying the but-for test, but for the actions of the defendant would the victim have died? The answer is yes. Therefore, he could not be liable for her death. Therefore there was no causal link between the defendant's action that is the poisoning and the result that is the death of murder. He could not be convicted of murder, but he was convicted for attempted murder. Whenever you are faced with a problem

question where causation is unclear, always start with but-for test using the case of *White*. as an authority. If you found that the but-for-test is satisfied and the results would not have happened without the defendant's actions, then you should go on to consider other elements of causation.

The second test is to consider whether legal causation can be established. Legal causation is more complex a concept than factual causation. Here, a judge can and often should give direction to the jury on the concept. When considering whether the threshold of legal causation was met, the principle to consider is whether the defendant action was substantial and operating cause in the result. It does not need to be the only cause but it needs to be more than minimal and the defendant's actions needed to have significantly contributed to the result.

Consider the case of *Benge* to make this point. In *Benge*, the defendant who was a foreman plate layer on a railway, he failed to check the train timetable and ensure that men working for him were safe on the line. A train came and killed four of the workmen. The defendant claimed that he was not the legal cause since the driver of the train could have prevented the deaths if he had kept a lookout. It was held, the defendant's contribution was substantial enough to justify, attribute responsibilities his death to him. His contribution was too substantial to be ignored. It was more than minimal.

Important part of establishing legal causation is trying to figure out whether any events or actions of another person broke the chain of causation. The rules or new intervening act comes under legal causation, but it is helpful to consider them separately as they're the most complex part of legal rules on causation. In problem questions, once you have established that there was factual causation and the but-for-test is satisfied and established that the defendant's actions were substantial on operating cause, then it is time to think about whether something else happened, and only then you can find causation.

To consider if there is a new intervening act, always ask, "Did anything happen between the actions of the defendant and the result?" If anything did happen, was that event or the intervention strong enough to break the chain of causation? These breaks in causations are called *Novus actus interveniens* in Latin or new intervening act in English. You can use either of these terms interchangeably. *Novus actus interveniens* or new intervening act, it can be divided into three: victim interventions, naturally occurring event interventions and third party interventions. In short, *Novus actus interveniens* means any action or event that took place between the defendant's actions and the result. When answering problem questions always consider, did anything happen between the actions of the defendant and the result? Was there perhaps a delay in the ambulance arriving? A third party intervening events? Maybe a hospital mixing up medications. If the defendant's conduct is substantial and operating cause despite any intervening act, the defendant is still criminally liable. If the new event is so potent that it becomes a new cause, then a chain of causation is broken. This means the defendant's action is no longer the cause and the defendant has no criminal liability.

Let's use the case of *Pagett* to illustrate the circumstances in which the courts can question whether a new intervening act arises. *Pagett* is one of the most important cases in relation to causation so you should ensure that you know the case and the legal principles that stem from it. You should also be noted that this is a tragic case and in many ways this is one of the sadder cases that you will come across in your study of criminal law.

The facts of the case are as follows: Pagett who was the appellant at the Court of appeal stage was a 31 year old man. He had separated from his wife and formed a relation to the young girl called Gail Kinchen. In June 1980 Gail, who was then 16 years old and she was 6 months pregnant by the defendant, left him after various domestic upsets and she returned home to live with her mother and her stepfather. One even Pagett went to Gail's house looking for her. He was fully armed with a shotgun and a number of cartridges. Gail wasn't at the house. Pagett shot and wounded the stepfather. He dragged Gail's mother off to his car, asking where Gail was. She

directed him to the area where she knew Gail was. She knew where her husband had earlier dropped Gail to visit her friend. They arrived at the friends flat and there were various people there, including Gail. He lined all the people up, waving his shotgun at them, he hit Gail and as her mother tried to grab the gun, he hit her in the ribs, knocking her on the floor. She was later to have found fractured ribs in her lower right chest. He called Gail who was crying and she went out. He hit her again in the hall, he was holding both Gail and her mother as a hostage.

He then drove off repeatedly hitting Gail in the car. At this point, the police were called and they started following him, they drove to his flat which was a block of flats nearby. Leaving the car to enter the flat, Gail's mother escaped while he was holding Gail as a hostage at gun point. A number of police cars were parked near, opposite the flash about 250 yards away. The police negotiators were called and they tried to establish contact to secure the release of Gail. He repeatedly said that he would shoot Gail and he would shoot himself if anyone came close, police decided to make an entry to the flat as negotiations were making no progress.

The corridor outside the flat had no lights and the police could not clearly see anything in the situation. As police were in the dark in the corridor, they made a move towards the flat and Pagett came out using Gail as a human shield. The police could not see this clearly as the corridor was dark and there was no lighting, they were shouting. Pagett fired first at the police, and the police fired back. The police said they had fired their guns instinctively not taking any particular aim. The bullets hit Gail who died alongside her unborn child, the question then arose, who was liable for the death of Gail?

Following the but-for-test, the fault clearly rested Pagett. The but-for Pagett using Gail as a shield, would she had died? No. His contribution to her death was more than minimal, it was substantive cause in her death but the question remained, did the actions of the police namely firing the shots that killed her, did they break the chain of causation? Was Pagett the cause or was the cause the police? Pagget Dry was tried and he was convicted of manslaughter, he then appealed on the basis of causation, arguing that since he did not fire the shots at Gail, he was not the cause of her death and he could not be held liable for her manslaughter, Pagett's appeal was dismissed by the court of appeal, the conduct of the police was justified according to court, as it was reasonable act of self-defense, and as such, it did not break the chain of causation.

In this case, a judge, Lord Justice Joff, he said that "there can be considered be no doubt that a reasonable act performed for the purpose of self preservation being of course itself an act caused by the defendant's own act, does not operate as a *Novus actus interveniens*." The court spent a long time deliberating on causation and in particular on the issue of when doe the actions of a third party break the chain of causation? The court agreed that it will only break the chain of causation if it is free, deliberate and informed. In this case, the actions of the police the court held, were none of those things and legal causation for the death of Gail remained with Pagget.

The acts of third parties need to be free, deliberate, and informed before they can break the chain of causation. This is one of the key things we get from the case of *Pagget*. In addition to interventions like that of police that visa seen, medical interventions are the type of new intervening acts that you are most likely to come across in the criminal law exams or problem questions. The questions on homicide might include things like a delay in ambulance arrival, wrong medication, poor hygiene standards by hospital, things that would've contributed or even directly led to the death of the victim.

When does bad medical treatment then break the chain of causation? Very rarely is the answer. Folowing the case of *Jordan*, it was held that only in exceptional cases would medical treatment break the chain of causation and only if it was palpably bad. Medical treatments can and do go wrong, and as a policy decision, the courts have been very reluctant to impose criminal liability on hospitals or to allow defendants to escape liability as a result, the current test to apply in these cases come from the case of *Cheshire* and the test is as follows. Intervene in medical treatment

could only be regarded as excluding the responsibility of the defendant if it was so independent of the defendants act and so potent in causing the death that the jury regarded the defendants acts as insignificant.

In problem questions where there had been bad medical treatment, please consider if it was so independent of the defendant's acts and so potent in causing the death that the defendants acts became insignificant. If so, there might be a break in chain of causation. It is important to remember that in this area of law, it is not a case of fairness or common sense approach. In many of these cases, bad medical treatment could be directly responsible for victims death, but it does not mean that the courts would not hold defendant liable. If the injury remains operating a substantial cause, the defendant is liable.If there is medical treatment that has gone wrong, please then apply this test form *Cheshire* and consider if the defendant is still liable.

Thinking about the possible events that can break the chain of causation, victim interventions can also break the chain of causation, much like third-party interventions. Is there anything that the victim did that might have broken the chain of causation is the question to ask. The general rule is that victim interventions can break the chain of causation if they're unforeseen by the defendant and if they're unforeseeable by a reasonable person.

For victim intervention to break the chain of causation, it needs to be therefore unforeseeable. The case of Roberts illustrates this well. In the case of Roberts, the defendant made sexual advances towards the victim who was in his car. She rebuffed his advances and when he did not assist, she jumped out of the car to get away from him. Having jumped out of the moving car, she suffered cuts and bruises. The defendant appealed stating that he should not be held liable for the injuries she sustained jumping out the car as he did not make her do this. The court rejected his appeal. They stated that it was foreseeable that a person would try to escape unwanted sexual advances and therefore he was liable for the injuries that she sustained while she was running away.

When thinking about victim interventions, it is important to remember that the thin skull rule applies here. The defendant must take the victims as he finds them. This means that if the victim happens to suffer from pre-existing medical condition such as a thin skull or hemophilia, this does not break the chain of causation. In the case of *Blaue*, it was decided that the concept of thin skull skull rule should not be applied only to medical organisations, but rather we should consider the victim as a whole holistic person. This means that if the victim has strong religious beliefs, this may prevent them from accepting medical treatment, this will not break the chain of causation.

In *Blaue*, the victim was stopped repeatedly by a man after she refuses sexual advances. She was taken to hospital and she probably would've survived if she received blood transfusion. The victim was, however, a Jehovah's Witness and she refused blood transfusion on religious grounds. She died in the hospital for the injuries that sustained. The question the court was then asked to consider is, did her refusal of medical treatment amount to a new intervening act? It did not, as the court held that her refusal was reasonable according to her own religious beliefs.

The next thing to consider in terms of breaking the chain of causation is naturally occurring disasters. These are exceedingly rare and the likelihood of you defending a client on this principle is small, but we will cover this nonetheless. If there is an unforeseeable event, akin to a natural disaster and the defense's actions-- between the defendant's actions and the result, this will break the chain of causation. For example, consider that we have two people on a pitch, Alan and Boris, who are having a fight on the pitch. Alan gets agitated and pushes Boris hard on the face. Boris falls down unconscious. Alan then walks away and leaves Boris on the pitch. If then entirely unforeseeable Tsunami comes and watches Boris to sea, this will be a break in causation.

Or if a lightning strikes out of a blue sky killing Boris on the spot, this would also be a breaking causation as Alan could not have foreseen these events. If however, the naturally occurring event is foreseeable such as the tide, there is no break in a chain of causation. These are incredibly rare occurrences though.

In summary, there are three rules that you must know when considering causation. These are factual causation and the but-for-test. This is the legal causation and finally, whether there was a new intervening act.

In this final part, I will now briefly introduce a past exam question relevant to Actus Reus. This will then be post at the forum and you can discuss it further. In the forum, you can find a number of shorter discussion points, and also you can find this past exam question. This question is from the exams of 2021. It is a multiple-problem question on omission liability. This is a fairly typical exam question. You can pause the video here and read the question in full.

In here, you have a number of scenarios where you need to assess whether the defendant had the duty to rescue. In other words, you must consider if the defendant had omission liability. You should consider each of the scenario carefully, separately from each other, and then consider which case would support your argument. Omission liability is covered by common law so you need to find a case to support your analysis and arguments for each of the scenarios. Once you have identified the relevant authority for each point, made your analysis, and concluded on it, you can post your answers and thoughts on the VLE and on the relevant forum discussions.

We have now come to the end of this Lecture Plus on Actus Reus. The most important takeaway from this lecture is perhaps to know that Actus Reus is a very important part of criminal liability and to learn how to identify Actus Reus in new offenses that you will come across throughout your study of criminal law. There are two aspects of Actus Reus that we have spent most amount of time on in this lecture. These are omission liability and causation. Both of these are absolutely crucial elements to know and both frequently appear in exams, either as independent questions or as part of wider problem questions.

Thank you for listening to this lecture. I hope to see your comments and your thoughts on the questions that we have posted on the forum later on.

## 3.1 What does the actus reus consist of?

The actus reus in crime comprises:

- conduct (always)
- any circumstances necessary to render that conduct wrongful (if any are required)
- result (if any is required).

In this topic, we will concentrate on the conduct and circumstances elements of actus reus.

**Study task 1**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 14.2.A.1 'Theft: the Elements and then consider answers to the following questions.

- a. What is the actus reus (criminal wrongdoing component) of theft?
- b. Which part of that actus reus describes the conduct prohibited by the offence?
- c. Which part of that actus reus describes the circumstances which must exist for that conduct to be wrongful?

Show feedback

- a. 'Appropriating property belonging to another'.
- b. 'Assuming (any of the) rights of ownership of the property'.
- c. No, see Pitham and Hehl.

### 3.1.1 Conduct: the act requirement

The core element of criminal liability is some form of prohibited conduct. Usually this prohibited conduct will involve a wrongful act. Identifying an act is therefore a key task for the prosecution. Although there are exceptions, generally, if the defendant has not acted, there can be no liability. This principle is known as the 'act requirement'.

### 3.1.2 What is an act?

There are two components to acts. The first is a 'bodily movement' (American Model Penal Code). The second is that the bodily movement be 'voluntary'.

A bodily movement

Taking murder as an example, the conduct element in murder consists of any act that causes the death of a human being. The prosecution must identify and prove that such an act took place.

There is no need for an act of violence; any act which causes death will do. Poisoning the victim's drink is an act. Cutting the brake cables of the victim's car is an act. In Hayward (1908) 21 Cox CC 692, it was sufficient that the accused threatened and chased his victim, who consequently died of a heart attack.

The corollary of this is that if A's contribution to the occurrence of a criminal harm can be described only as 'doing nothing' or 'not lifting a finger', they cannot be held criminally accountable for that harm.

#### **Illustration 1**

Noor sees Parveen, a blind woman whom she does not like, about to step out into a road, unaware that a lorry is approaching at great speed. Noor does nothing to warn Parveen, who dies in the resulting crash.

Here there can be no criminal liability in respect of Noor. Parveen did not die as a result of any bodily movement on the part of Noor. Doing nothing is not an act.

The bodily movement must be voluntary.

The second component of the act requirement is that the bodily movement is voluntary. In Bratty v A-G for Northern Ireland [1961] 3 All ER 523 HL, Lord Denning explained this as follows:

No act is punishable if it is done involuntarily: and an involuntary act in this context... means an act which is done by the muscles without any control by the mind, such as a spasm, a reflex action or a convulsion; or an act done by a person who is not conscious of what he is doing, such as an act done whilst suffering from concussion or whilst sleepwalking...

#### **Illustration 2**

Yasmin is waiting at the kerbside waiting to cross a busy road. Aisha trips over a brick and stumbles into Yasmin, thus propelling her on to the road. Yasmin is injured in the resulting collision with a car.

Aisha cannot be criminally liable for the injury to Yasmin because her act is involuntary. She was not in control of the actions which led to Yasmin's injury.

Where a defendant has no control over what they are doing, they are said to be acting in a state of automatism. Like insanity, its close cousin, automatism is a defence to criminal liability: both will be looked at in detail in Topic 10 of this module guide.

### 3.1.3 Am I able to identify the act component in an actus reus?

To decide whether D has committed the actus reus of a crime you need to:

- find the definition of the crime
- · distil from that definition the actus reus
- identify from that actus reus the act of the defendant which you are to rely on in establishing that actus reus. This is not always easy.

### 3.1.4 Exceptions to the act requirement

Although the conduct element in crimes generally is an act, there are some exceptions. For certain statutory offences, liability is often based upon a failure to act as the law requires, as in failing to wear a seatbelt, failing to tax one's car, failing to submit a tax return or failing to display a licence plate. Such offences are typically statutory strict liability offences designed to regulate behaviour rather than punish moral wrongdoing. They are known as statutory crimes of omission.

Criminal liability may also on occasion be based upon being in possession of a prohibited article: for example, controlled drugs, extreme pornography, offensive weapons or articles for use in terrorist offences. These again are statutory crimes and are known as crimes of possession.

The final exception is what is termed 'situational liability'. The prohibition for these offences is not some form of act but, similar to the other two exceptions, simply being in a prohibited situation. For example, it is a crime to be drunk in a public place, or to be drunk in charge of a vehicle, or to be the owner of certain types of dangerous dogs (such as a pit bull terrier) or to allow a dog to be dangerously out of control in a public place.

The problem posed by both possession offences and situational liability is that criminal liability does not depend upon the defendant having chosen to be in possession of the prohibited object or be in the prohibited situation. In other words, no wrongdoing is required. The offence in the case of owning a pit bull terrier is constituted although the dog was by way of an unsolicited gift and although the defendant believed the dog to be of another breed. The offence in the case of the out-of-control dog is constituted although the defendant performed no act and took reasonable steps to keep the dog under control (see *Elvin* [1994] 1 WLR 1057). In relation to crimes of

possession, a person can be guilty of being in possession of a dangerous weapon when they believed the article in their possession was, for example, a torch and not, as it subsequently transpired, a taser (Deyemi [2008] 1 Cr App R 25).

**Study task 2**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 4.5.A 'Situational liability' and B 'Possession offences'.

Consider answers to the following questions.

- a. Why do commentators object to the decisions in *Winzar* (1983) and Larsonneur (1933)? Do you agree that they were objectionable? ('Larsonneur revisited' is available to download from Copyright materials.)
- b. Is the decision in Robinson-Pierre consistent with Elvin? Is it a good decision?

#### Omissions and commissions

We have seen how a failure to act may serve as the *actus reus* of an offence where the defendant is placed under a statutory duty to act as the statute requires. These are known as crimes of omission. This is an exception to the act requirement in criminal law. However, since the behaviour demanded by the statute is clearly specified and is not onerous in its demands, it is not contrary to principle.

A more controversial exception to the act requirement concerns crimes of commission. Can these be committed by omission? Crimes of commission are those crimes whose definition includes an *actus reus* which satisfies the act requirement, but whose result component can be caused by doing nothing. For example, the actus reus of murder is 'an unlawful killing'. Dictionaries define 'kill' as 'an act of killing', but also define it simply as 'causing death'. An act of killing involves some affirmative action such as a stabbing, a shooting, a beating, a poisoning, a suffocating and so on. But it is possible to 'cause death' by doing nothing. For example, it is a perfectly correct use of language to say that a parent who gives their baby no food, so that it dies, causes the death of the child – and indeed 'kills' the child. The controversy concerns how far this principle should stretch. Only one person can pull a trigger, but every passerby who sees a baby drowning in a puddle but does nothing to help can be said to 'cause' the baby's death. Are they all to be charged with murder? How do we ensure that only the truly deserving suffer conviction and punishment?

#### Key requirements for criminal liability

To ensure the net of criminal responsibility is not spread too far, there are certain key restrictions on criminal liability for crimes of commission in cases of harm caused by omission.

- 1. The conduct element of the crime in question must be capable of commission by omission.
- 2. The circumstances must be such as to create a legal duty to act.
- 3. The defendant's failure to act must be in breach of that duty.
- 4. The defendant's failure to act must be voluntary.
- 5. The harm must be caused by the omission.
- 1. The conduct element of the crime in question must be capable of commission by omission

Most result crimes can be committed by omission. This includes theft, murder, criminal damage, fraud and most forms of manslaughter. Some, however, cannot. The definitions of some offences specify or imply that only acts are sufficient. Assault is one. So, in R v Dunn [2015] EWCA Crim 724, D was charged with indecent assault. What he had done was to cause a 15-year-old girl to masturbate him. The Court of Appeal held that the offence was not made out. Indecent assault requires there to be an assault. An assault requires some form of act on D's part. Here the act was the girl's, not his. D had committed an offence but not this one. This offence was causing a child to engage in sexual activity (s.10 Sexual Offences Act 2003).

2. The circumstances must be such as to create a legal duty to act

Assuming the offence is capable of being committed by omission, a successful prosecution can occur only if the defendant's omission was in breach of a legal duty to act. This is why parents may be quilty of homicide for failing to feed their children, or for neglecting them. They are guilty because parents owe a statutory duty of care to their children. The number of duty situations are limited. They are the subject of a mini lecture on the VLE and they are discussed in Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 4.5.D.3 'Circumstances giving rise to a duty to act: duty situations'. These need to be learned and understood.

In the absence of a duty of intervention or rescue, an omission, however reprehensible, cannot form the basis of a criminal prosecution. In the famous example of Sir James Fitzjames Stephen:

A sees B drowning and is able to save him by holding out his hand. A abstains from doing so in order that B may be drowned, and B is drowned. A has committed no offence.

(A digest of the criminal law, 1887)

This makes it important to know whether the conduct of the accused is an act or an omission, because a person's criminal liability depends upon it. For example, if in a variation of the above example, A holds out his hand for B to grasp and then removes his hand from B's grip when realising B is his deadly enemy, is this a case of omission or commission? If it is the latter, then A is guilty of murder; if the former, then it is nothing.

So much hangs on a simple question of definition. The usual definition of an act, as we know, is 'a bodily movement'. Since A has moved his body, then, assuming death would have been prevented by maintaining his grip, A seems to be guilty of murder. Simple in theory, but not so simple in practice. To understand why you will need to read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 4.5D.1 and answer the questions in the Topic 3 – Discussion activity.

3. The defendant's failure to act must be in breach of that duty

D's failure to act does not necessarily mean that D is in breach of duty. For example, in cases where D has a duty of rescue but failed to rescue someone, D is not liable for a failure to rescue if:

- they did as much as could be expected in the circumstances
- performance of the duty was impossible
- the failure to act was justified.

To know and understand the above three situations, you will need now to complete Study task 3.

#### **Study task 3**

Reading for this activity: Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 4.5.D.4 'Circumstances governing the scope of the duty'.

Identify examples of how a person can or has avoided liability for omitting to act on the basis of any of the three situations mentioned in the text.

4. The defendant's failure to act must be voluntary

If D's failure to act was due to his being unconscious or being restrained, the failure is involuntary and cannot form the subject matter of a criminal offence, even though D was under a duty of intervention.

5. The harm must be caused by the omission

The prosecution must be able to prove that the defendant's breach of duty caused the harm. In Morby (1882) 8 QBD 571, a parent failed to call for medical support for his ailing child. The child subsequently died of smallpox. The parent was convicted of manslaughter at first instance, but the Court for Crown Cases Reserved allowed the appeal, since the prosecution could not prove that prompt medical attention would have saved the child. Put

another way, the prosecution could not prove that the defendant's failure to perform his duty had caused the infant's death, since the child might have died anyway. For more information on what must be proved to show that the prohibited harm was caused by the accused's act or omission, see Topic 4.

#### **Study task 4**

Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 4.5.D 'Omissions and crimes of commission' and try to answer the following questions.

- a. Assault is one of those few result crimes which cannot be committed by omission. Why then was the defendant in Fagan v MPC (1969) (Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 8.1.A 'Temporal coincidence') found guilty of assault when he refused to remove his car which had been inadvertently parked on a policeman's foot? It might be helpful to read the case report in the Online Library.
- b. Read Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 4.5.D.3(d) 'The duty to avert a dangerous situation caused by the defendant' and (e) 'Miller and beyond'. How does the case of Evans (2009) extend the principle in Miller  $(1983)?$
- c. What reason did the House of Lords give for deciding that if doctors turned off Anthony Bland's life support machine this would be an omission, not an act?
- d. Consider the case of Morby (1882). Is it ever possible for the prosecution to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that V would not have died when he did if D had sought prompt medical care? Does this put an undue burden on the prosecution?

## 3.2 Circumstances

As was outlined in Topic 2 (Section 2.2.1), the definition of certain crimes requires proof that certain circumstances existed which convert what would otherwise be an innocuous act into a criminal act. Obvious examples include rape and assault, both of which can be committed only where the victim does not consent. Absence of consent, for these crimes, is therefore a circumstance which can convert an ordinarily quite lawful act (sexual intercourse or a simple touching) into the *actus reus* of a crime.

### **Study task 5**

Look at the definitions of theft and a firearms offence and answer the questions below.
**Theft**

(1) A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it; and "thief" and "steal" shall be construed accordingly. (s.1, Theft Act 1968)

**Firearms**

(1) Subject to any exemption under this Act, it is an offence for a person  $-$ 

(a) to have in his possession, or to purchase or acquire, a firearm to which this section applies without holding a firearm certificate in force at the time, or otherwise than as authorised by such a certificate. (s.1, Firearms Act 1968)

In each case state:

- a. the prohibited conduct
- b. the prohibited circumstances.

## Sample examination question 1

**Question**

Consider the arguments, both for and against, for expanding the range of duty situations which ground liability for omissions. Should there be a general duty of easy rescue?

**Feedback**

First analyse what the question requires of you. This question involves two parts. The first part asks you to consider changes to the present law involving the possible creation of new duty situations. So you will need to state and discuss the present duty situations and then consider whether some other duty situations should be added, e.g. a duty on cohabitants to intervene if another cohabitant is in danger (see Wilson and Lammasniemi, Section 4.D.3(e) for some other possibilities).

The second asks you to consider whether we should stop limiting liability for omissions to a small range of duty situations and create a general duty to intervene whenever we are in a position to prevent harm.

Using Wilson and Lammasniemi, from Section 4.5.C and D to the end of the chapter, write a one-page skeleton answer to this question which highlights at least three reasons why criminal liability for omitting to prevent harm is thought a bad idea (or why the current range of duty situations are sufficient) and three responses to those objections. Also suggest at least three examples of duty situations which should or could be added to the present list, together with arguments against. Finally consider the arguments, for and against, for giving everybody a general responsibility to help others in peril.

## Sample examination question 2

**Question**

(Tutor feedback activity 2023)

'The range of duty situations which ground liability for omissions is far too narrow and should be expanded. Imposing a general duty of "easy rescue" would be straightforward and a welcome development of the law.' Discuss.

**Tutor guidance**

As this is a formative, please focus on points of improvement in terms of substantive knowledge, essay writing skills and analysis in the feedback. Poor answers might simply rehearse the duty situations, with no effective attempt to evaluate the area of law or to engage with the question. If the student did not engage with the question /statement and discuss expanding duty, it would be good to note this in the feedback and highlight the importance of answering the specific question asked.

**Key elements**

- 1. critical evaluation: this can be done by critically discussing the merits of omissions liability in light of case law;
- 2. discussion of the arguments for and against expanding the existing system by having a general duty of intervention;
- 3. using the above discussion to form an argument in favour of current state of affairs/ reform of some kind.

Law cases, reports and other references that could be included:

Indicative cases - Airedale NHST v Bland, Instan, Pittwood, Miller, Bonnyman, Dytham, Evans, Broughton, Stone and Dobinson and laws, e.g. Children and Young Persons Act, also commentators on this question such as Ashworth and Glanville Williams, comparative legal analysis, e.g. French Criminal Code.

A good answer to this question could include the following

- An outline of the *actus reus* principle and an explanation and discussion on the principles governing liability for omissions, including reference to statutory crimes of omission.
- Explain the duty situations including references to case law, highlighting inconsistencies and developments; better answers would make direct reference to the statement and narrowness of the duty situations.
- Evaluate the cogency of the act/omission distinction; giving illustrations of the general principle of no liability for omissions, such as the baby in the puddle.

- Evaluate this area of law, including discussion of how far the law measures up to the need to ally just rules with moral obligations and make suggestions for improving the situation - this is essential for high quality answers/ very good marks. Here better students might refer to the Ashworth v Williams debate.
- Might refer to the distinction between a generalised duty to act (for example, the French system) and being accountable for the consequences of omitting to act would be useful.

## Sample examination question 3

**Question**

(Peer feedback activity 2025)

For each of the scenarios (a)–(g), explain whether A was under a duty to rescue and why:

- a. A is a swimming pool attendant. He sees V, a swimmer, struggling out of her depth in the pool.
- b. A is the mother of V. She sees V struggling out of her depth in the pool.
- c. A is the 20-year-old son of V. He sees V struggling out of her depth in the pool.
- d. A is the owner of the swimming bath. She sees V struggling out of her depth in the pool.
- e. A is the mother of T, aged 10, who has invited his friend V, also aged 10, to go swimming with him at the local pool. A sees V struggling out of his depth in the pool.
- f. A and V are an unmarried couple who live together. A sees V struggling out of his depth in the pool.
- g. A, who is supervising her child at a swimming pool, drops an ice cream accidentally at the poolside. V, a child, slips on the ice cream and falls into the pool. A sees V struggling out of her depth in the pool.

**Feedback prompts**

The feedback prompts below outline the areas that could have been included in the answer. They were used in the activity for students and tutors to give feedback to others on how well the answer addressed the question.

- 1. Has the answer addressed all the questions (a-g) in equal length and detail? If not, which answers provide a better understanding of omission liability, and why?
- 2. Does each of the answers (a-q) identify and address the core issue in the specific scenario? In other words, does each answer consider the relationship between A and V, and evaluate whether that relationship gives rise to a specific duty?
- 3. Do the answers (a-g) demonstrate knowledge of the various relationships under which a duty can arise, and how these relationships differ from one another? For example, does the discussion in answers (a) and (d) show consideration of how different duties can arise within the same workplace, and analyse why?
- 4. Does each of the answers use relevant legal authority (legislation and/or case law) to support the discussion? Are the key cases relevant to each category identified?
- 5. Based on your reading, does the answer accurately apply the facts from the scenario to the legal principles discussed? Are there any misinterpretations or irrelevant points that need addressing?

- 6. Does the answer explain the core legal principle from each authority, and then apply it to the specific scenario? In other words, does each answer apply the law to the facts as given in the question?
- 7. Is the conclusion to each scenario clearly explained? In other words, does the answer specify whether the duty exists?

**Answer guidance**

Please note, the notes below are not full answers. In the exam, you would be expected to write full paragraphs of analysis on the cases, and how they apply.

- a. Consider Pittwood/contractual duty. If A was off duty, this is no duty to assist (Dytham). There is no general duty to assist, but a contractual duty would apply.
- b. A is the mother and therefore has a duty deriving from a special relationship (e.g. Gibbins and Proctor, or the statutory duty under s1(1) Children and Young Persons Act 1933).
- c. There is probably no duty as there is no special relationship as the son is an adult (Gibbins and Proctor), but it requires discussion on that point and how far a special relationship extends (e.g.  $R$  v Chattaway).
- d. Explore the contractual basis for a duty, but does it extend to the owner or only those who are contractually bound to safeguard? Answers might distinguish Pittwood here and say there is no duty as no category applies.
- e. Consider if there is voluntary assumption of duty (e.g. Instan; Stone and Dobinson)
- f. There is potentially a special relationship, however since they are not married, it is necessary to consider if that still be applicable. The answer should comment on the requirement that this area of law should not discriminate between married and unmarried couples and may draw from US cases such as People v Beardsley to consider how law has developed elsewhere. R v Hood could also be considered.
- g. The duty is based upon the creation of/contributing to a dangerous situation (e.g. Miller, Evans).
