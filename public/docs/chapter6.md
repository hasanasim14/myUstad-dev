### Introduction

So far we have learned that criminal liability requires *actus reu*s and *mens rea*. *Actus reu*s is the external element in the crime package; *mens rea* is the internal element – that which the prosecution has to show was going on in the defendant's mind. We need to understand something further about these elements, namely that in relation to any given crime, *actus reus* and *mens rea* should, in principle, coincide.

There are two facets to this premise. The first is that *actus reus* and *mens rea* should coincide in point of time; that is, liability should depend upon proof that the defendant had the relevant mental attitude **at the moment of** doing the acts which form the *actus reus* of a criminal offence. This is known as **temporal coincidence**. The second facet is that offence definitions should match any relevant conduct, consequence or circumstance with an exactly matching mental state on the part of the defendant. This is known as the **correspondence principle**. Without such correspondence, it is thought, the defendant will be punished for the wrong harm.

**page 63**
### 6.1 Temporal coincidence

Temporal coincidence is an easy concept to grasp, a less easy concept to apply. Here are some examples falling on either side of the liability fence.

#### **Illustration 6.1**

**D takes V's wallet, intending to steal from it. A few seconds later he changes his mind and puts the wallet back. Is he guilty of theft?**

The commonsense answer is no. D momentarily had the *mens rea* for theft but since he decided to put the wallet back there was no *actus reus*. This is not the legal answer. To discover this we need to apply the lawyer's method. This requires us to consider the definition of theft. Here is a simplified version:

- A person is guilty of theft if they take property belonging to another intending not to return it.

This definition tells us that the offence is made out, since at the time D took the property it was his intention not to return it. *Actus reus* and *mens rea*, thus, coincided in point of time.

We have already come across a few cases where this principle was at issue. One is *Ahmad* (1986) Crim LR 739*,* where the landlord was charged with harassing his tenant with intent to make him give up occupation. The landlord was not guilty of this crime because he had formed the intention only **after** he had committed the acts (removing windows) relied upon as acts of harassment. See Wilson, Section 4.5.D.2 'Omissions: the common law approach'.

#### **Activity 6.1**

**Read Wilson, Section 8.1 'Introduction' and answer the following question.**

**D is a contract killer, with a contract to kill V. He drives to V's house with his gun. On the way there D is involved in an accident when a pedestrian unexpectedly runs out in front of his car. The pedestrian is killed. D gets out of his car to discover the victim is V. D rubs his hands, pleased that he has been saved some effort. Is D guilty of murder?** 

#### **6.1.1 Avoiding the coincidence requirement**

If act and mind do not coincide in time this is not always fatal to a successful prosecution. This is because it may be possible to ignore the initial act and graft liability on to a subsequent omission. This is what happened in *Miller* (1983) (see Chapter 3, Activity 3.8 of this module guide). The act which caused the fire in this case was unaccompanied by *mens rea*, since D was asleep at the time. *Mens rea* was formed only after the act was complete, when D woke up and realised his bed was on fire. This will normally mean that D would escape liability for criminal damage. The House of Lords ruled, however, that the *actus reus* could be based upon D's omission to put out the fire, which omission **was** accompanied by *mens rea* (recklessness). *Actus reus*  and *mens rea* coincided, therefore, **at the moment of** D's deciding not to put the fire out because here the *actus reus* was D's omission. The crime was constituted by his reckless (*mens rea*) omission in breach of duty (*actus reus*).

Another way in which the coincidence requirement has been avoided is by reference to the **continuing act** doctrine. In *Fagan* v *MPC* [1969] 1 QB 439 there appeared to be a classic example of a case where the *mens rea* and *actus reus* did not coincide, since *mens rea* was formed only after the harm-causing act had been performed. D had innocently parked his car on a police officer's foot, which he realised only after he had turned the engine off. At that moment he decided not to remove the car. D was convicted at first instance of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty. He argued that there had been no assault since the **act** of assault took place without *mens rea*, and when he later formed the *mens rea* there was no accompanying act. It was central to his argument that assault required an act and could not be committed by omission. The Queen's Bench Division agreed that assault required an act and could not be committed by omission. Nevertheless, it affirmed the conviction.

**page 64**
##### **Activity 6.2**

- **a. Read Wilson, Section 8.1.A.1 'Qualifications to the requirement of temporal coincidence', Section (b) 'Continuing acts'. How did the court justify affirming the conviction when it agreed that assault could not be committed by omission?**
- **b. Read the case of** *Director of Public Prosecutions* **v** *Santana-Bermudez* **[2003] EWHC 2908 (Admin) and consider what the act was which constituted the assault in this case. Or was the conduct of S a culpable omission under the** *Miller* **principle (and so inconsistent with** *Fagan***)?**

#### **6.1.2 The supposed corpse cases**

The principles in *Miller* and *Fagan* constitute two qualifications to the rule that *actus reus* and *mens rea* should coincide in point of time. But they are not exceptions: they are ways of avoiding its application. The supposed corpse cases, however, are an exception to the rule. These are cases where the defendant has attacked the victim and, wrongly concluding the victim is dead, disposed of the body, which disposal is the actual cause of death.

The first case in which this complex scenario surfaced, *Meli* v *The Queen* [1954] 1 WLR 228, was a case involving a preconceived plan to kill the victim. Their plan was to lure V to a hut in a deserted spot, beat him to death and then roll him over a cliff to fake an accident. The plan nearly worked perfectly. The defendants lured V successfully to the spot, beat him up and then, having concluded that V was dead, they rolled him over the cliff. Actually he was not dead at the time. He died as a result of exposure from being left at the foot of the cliff. The defendants were charged with murder. They argued that the act which caused death (the disposal of the supposed corpse) was unaccompanied by *mens rea* since at that time they thought death had already occurred, and so *actus reus* and *mens rea* did not coincide. Not surprisingly the Privy Council rejected this argument.

*It appears to their Lordships impossible to divide up what was really one transaction in this way. There is no doubt that the accused set out to do all these acts in order to achieve their plan and as parts of their plan; and it is much too refined a ground of judgement to say that, because they were under a misapprehension at one stage and thought that their guilty purpose had been achieved before in fact it was achieved, therefore they are to escape the penalties of the law. (Lord Reid)*

In *Church* [1966] 1 QB 59, where there was no preconceived plan, a different explanation was given which centred on the chain of causation. D panicked when, having struck V, she fell down, apparently dead. D threw the supposed corpse in the river, and V died of drowning. D was charged and convicted of manslaughter but argued that *actus reus* and *mens rea* did not coincide. The Queen's Bench Division disagreed, recommending that homicide is the appropriate verdict if the appellant's 'behaviour from the moment he first struck her to the moment when he threw her into the river' could be regarded 'as a series of acts designed to cause death or grievous bodily harm'. If that was how the jury 'regarded the accused's behaviour, it mattered not whether he believed her to be alive or dead when he threw her in the river' (Edmund-Davies J).

Put simply, D had the *mens rea* for manslaughter when he first struck V. V died following a series of further acts on D's part, none of which broke the chain of causation.

This causation account was elaborated upon in *Le Brun* [1992] QB 61. The defendant struck his wife in the course of an argument outside their front door. She fell down, struck her head and lapsed into unconsciousness. She died as a result of injuries sustained when D dragged her from the road into the house to avoid detection. In response to the argument that *mens rea* and *actus reus* did not coincide, Lord Lane CJ for the Court of Appeal said:

**page 65**
*It would be possible to express the problem as one of causation. The original unlawful blow to the chin was a *causa sine qua non* (but for cause) of the later *actus reus*. It was the opening event in a series which was to culminate in death: the first link in the chain of causation, to use another metaphor. It cannot be said that the actions of the appellant in dragging the victim away with the intention of evading liability broke the chain which linked the initial blow with the death. In short, in circumstances such as the present, which is the only concern of this court, the act which causes death, and the necessary mental state to constitute manslaughter, need not coincide in point of time.*

##### **Activity 6.3**

**Read Wilson, Sections 8.1.A 'Temporal coincidence' and 5.5.B.1 'The general framework for imputing cause' and answer the following question.**

**Lord Lane CJ says in** *Le Brun* **'It cannot be said that the actions of the appellant in dragging the victim away with the intention of evading liability broke the chain which linked the initial blow with the death'. If, as he also states, the 'problem is (only) one of causation' why should it matter what the appellant's intentions were in dragging the victim away? What intentions would break the chain of causation and why?**

### **6.2 Correspondence principle**

Simply put, the correspondence principle requires a corresponding mental element for each aspect of the *actus reus*; that is, conduct, circumstance and consequence. The principle derives from the broader ethical principle that conviction and punishment be deserved. If a person can be punished for doing X without a mental element corresponding to X, then the punishment is undeserved and unfair.

#### **Illustration 6.2**

**A person is guilty of theft if they dishonestly appropriate property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. The** *actus reus* **of theft is appropriating property belonging to another. The correspondence principle, as a minimum, requires that:**

- **a. A intends to appropriate the property. So if the property is secreted in her bag without her knowing, the correspondence principle requires an acquittal.**
- **b. A intends to appropriate property belonging to another. This requires her to know or believe that the property she is appropriating belongs to someone else. So if A takes an umbrella from a stand believing it is her own or has been abandoned, the correspondence principle demands an acquittal.**

#### **Activity 6.4**

**If it is an offence for a person to have sexual intercourse with a person lacking mental capacity, what (corresponding)** *mens rea* **does the correspondence principle require?** 

The correspondence principle is an ethical or normative principle rather than a descriptive principle. In practice, a good many crimes can be committed without a perfect match between *actus reus* and *mens rea*. Indeed, the majority of crimes of violence bear an *actus reus* without a corresponding mental attitude. Murder is a prime example.

#### **Activity 6.5**

**Read Wilson, Section 8.1.B.1 'Qualifications to the requirement of definitional concurrence', Section (b) 'Definitional non-correspondence' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. Which important offences breach the correspondence principle?**
- **b. How does Horder justify these breaches in his article 'Transferred malice and the remoteness of unexpected outcomes' (2006)** *Crim LR* **383 (available in Westlaw)?**
- **c. A, intending to teach V a lesson, breaks V's legs with a baseball bat. V, attempting to get up, falls over and hits his head on the pavement, which kills him. Should A be guilty of murder? Is she guilty?**

**page 66**
### **6.3 Transferred malice: a qualification to the correspondence principle**

No breach of the correspondence principle occurs if the defendant commits the formal *actus reus* of an offence with the relevant *mens rea* for that offence, but the subject matter of that *actus reus* was other than that intended or foreseen by the defendant.

#### **Illustration 6.3**

**D, intending to shoot B dead, misses B and kills C, an innocent bystander.**

D is still guilty of murder. He has the *mens rea* for murder and he has committed the *actus reus* of murder. He has also committed the offence of attempted murder in relation to B (*R* v *Gnango* [2011] UKSC 59). The criminal law permits the *mens rea* in relation to B to be joined to the *actus reus* committed against C. This qualification is known as the doctrine of **transferred malice**.

*The effect of transferred malice … is that the intended victim and the actual victim are treated as if they were one, so that what was intended to happen to the first person (but did not happen) is added to what actually did happen to the second person (but was not intended to happen), with the result that what was intended and what happened are married to make a notionally intended and actually consummated crime. The cases are treated as if the actual victim had been the intended victim from the start.*
*(Lord Mustill in *A-G's Reference (No 3 of 1994)* [1998] AC 245 at 262.)*

The principle applies to all crimes of violence, not merely murder. So in *Latimer* (1886) 17 QBD 359 D swung a belt at X in a pub, which missed X and hit V, standing behind him. D was found guilty of assault against V although he neither intended to hit V nor even knew V was there. In each case the malice/intention D entertained with respect to the intended victim transfers to the *actus reus* of the crime committed against the real victim.

It applies even where the harm suffered by the unintended victim differs from that which the attacker intended his victim to suffer. This was made clear in in *R* v *Grant* [2014] EWCA Crim 143. D fired shots into a shop intending to kill X. The shots missed and hit V1 and V2 who were bystanders. D was charged with attempted murder (on X) and causing grievous bodily harm with intent, contrary to s.18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in relation to V1 and V2. D argued that the transferred malice principle only applied where the crime committed against the unintended victim was identical to that intended against the intended victim. Here it was not. He argued that the fact he intended to kill X meant that he did not have the intention to cause X GBH. As a result, there was no 'malice' to transfer. The court rejected this argument. If D had the intention to kill X he must also have had the intention to do him serious injury by definition.

One qualification is in order. The principle applies only with respect to crimes of the same family. In *Pembliton* (1874) D threw a stone at X in the course of a fight with X and Y. It missed X and broke a window. D was indicted for criminal damage. The Court for Crown Cases Reserved said that the intention to harm X (a crime against the person) was not sufficient to support a conviction for causing criminal damage to V's property (a crime against property). Lord Blackburn said that D could be guilty of criminal damage only if he intended or foresaw damage to the window. Since that had not been argued by the prosecution the conviction was quashed.

#### Activity 6.6**

**Read Wilson, Section 8.1.B 'Definitional concurrence' and answer the following questions.**

- **a. A fires a gun at B, intending to kill him. The bullet misses B and rebounds off the wall, injuring C. Can A be charged with wounding with intent?**
- **b. A fires a gun at B, who is in a car. The bullet hits the car door and rebounds, killing C's dog who is on the pavement. Is A guilty of causing criminal damage to the dog?**
