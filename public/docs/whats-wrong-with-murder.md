## whats's wrong with murder
Murder is the most serious form of criminal homicide. It is separated from manslaughter and other criminal homicides by its fault element. On conviction for murder the sentence is a mandatory life sentence. Unlike manslaughter, the judge has no discretion. This lecture covers many of the perceived problems surrounding the law of murder – its fault element and the mandatory sentence. There are others. We will deal with these another time.

The fault element

- The fault element in murder is an intention to kill or an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. Grievous bodily harm means serious bodily harm.
- These are alternate fault elements.

- 1. The first problem
- What is it to intend to kill someone or to intend to cause someone serious injury beyond having that consequence as your purpose?
- The problem posed by *Woollin* (1998) and indirect intention.

2. The second problem

• There are cases where reckless killers are more wicked than intentional killers. Should this not be reflected in the offence label so that certain reckless killers are also guilty of murder?

3. The third problem – the mandatory sentence

- If some reckless killers are more wicked than some intentional killers should judges not have a sentencing discretion?
- Most commentators and judges think so but parliament will not be moved.

3. The fourth problem

• Why is the intention to cause serious injury sufficient mens rea for murder given that this creates a mismatch between the mens rea and the actus reus (causing death)?

• GBH murder does have some support. For example, John Gardner (1994) argues that an intention to cause serious harm crosses a moral threshold, at which point the defendant is responsible for creating his own bad luck.

The fifth problem

• What exactly does grievous bodily harm mean anyway? Is it a sufficiently secure concept for the jury to be able to work with when deciding whether someone is guilty of murder?

Proposals for reform

- The Law Commission has addressed these problems by providing a two tier system which allows both offence label and sentence to match the degree of heinousness displayed in the particular killing.
- The final slides outline the Law Commission's latest thinking on murder and the boundary with manslaughter. For full discussion read Wilson 13.4.

## Law Commission Report 304 Murder and Manslaughter

- 1. Murder, Manslaughter and Infanticide: Reform Proposals
- The division between murder and manslaughter to be replaced by a three-tier division:
- FIRST DEGREE MURDER (mandatory life sentence)
- SECOND DEGREE MURDER (discretionary life sentence)
- MANSLAUGHTER (discretionary life sentence)

2. First Degree Murder (mandatory life sentence)
- (a) intentional killing; or
- (b) killing with an intention to cause serious injury, in the awareness that there is a serious risk of causing death.

3. Second Degree Murder (no mandatory sentence) will encompass:
- (a) killing with intent to do serious injury; or
- (b) killing with an intent to cause some injury or fear or risk of injury, in the awareness that there is a serious risk of causing death; and
- (c) killing with the intent for first degree murder, but where a defence of loss of self-control, diminished responsibility, or suicide pact succeeds.
