- References to crime are everywhere in media, news, popular culture, literature…

Factual: A body of rules that set out the definitions of criminal offences and describes punishments

Conceptual: Politically determined restriction on individual rights, through the threat or the imposition of a penal sanction

## Criminal offences

- Conduct amounting to criminal offence is of such social impact that the state chooses to intervene (to prosecute, punish)
