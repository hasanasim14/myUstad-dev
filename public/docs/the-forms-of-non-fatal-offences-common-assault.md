## The Forms of Non Fatal Offences:

- 1. Crimes of Violence
- 2. Crimes against Autonomy

### Crimes of violence

- **Crimes of violence** include sections 47, 20 and 19 Offences Against the Person Act 1861.
- The wrongdoing in each is the causing of physical harm to another.
- Proof of physical harm is therefore an essential element
- Victim's lack of consent is not an essential element. (*Donovan 1937*)

### Crimes Against Autonomy

- Crimes Against Autonomy the wrongdoing in each case is an interference with a person's control of his/her body.
- Absence of consent is, therefore, an essential element
- Physical harm is not an essential element
- Assault
- Battery
- False Imprisonment
- Rape

Crimes Against Autonomy: Assault and Battery

**COMMON ASSAULT (S39 CJA 1988)**

Takes two forms

• *Assault***:** 

* A person is guilty of assault if he intentionally or recklessly leads someone to expect the (non consensual) application to his body of immediate unlawful force.' (Venna)*

• *Battery*

'any act by which D, intentionally or recklessly, inflicts (non consensual) unlawful force upon P.' (Venna)

#### Crimes Against Autonomy: Assault

1. Assault

• Actus Reus – acting so as to lead victim to expect immediate unlawful force

(i) Threat of Force

- Eg pointing a gun (St George)
- Rolling up one's sleeves (*Stephens v Myers*)
- Putting one's hand on ones sword (*Tuberville v Savage*)
- Making as if to kiss someone (*Roberts*)
- Staring through a window (*Smith v Woking Police*)
- Making a Threatening phone call (*Ireland*)

#### Crimes Against Autonomy: Battery

- 2. Battery
- 'any act by which D, intentionally or recklessly, inflicts (non consensual) unlawful force upon P.' (*Venna*)

 *Actus Reus*

- An act is necessary: *Fagan* (1983)
- Force is necessary (Walkden)
- Indirect force is sufficient *Haystead v CC of Derby (2000); Santana- Bermudez* (2004)

### Mens Rea of Common Assault

- 1. Intending or foreseeing that one's unlawful act will result in physical contact with V. (**battery**)
- 2. Intending or foreseeing that one's unlawful act will cause V to fear suffering unlawful force (**assault**)

D does not commit the offence if he/she believed his/her conduct to be lawful

- Using force in the belief it is necessary in self defence or defence of others, *R v Williams*
- Using force against V in the belief it is consented to by V HKSAR v LAU SHING CHUNG (2014)
- "The mental element to be proved is an intent to apply unlawful force. It follows, in cases where the absence of consent is in issue, that if a defendant honestly believes that the person whom he assaults is consenting, the mental element is not proved, even if the belief is a mistaken belief" HKSAR v LAU SHING CHUNG SIMON (2014)
